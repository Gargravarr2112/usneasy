firefox vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.10
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in Firefox.

Software Description:
- firefox: Mozilla Open Source web browser

Details:

Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Mats Palmgren, Chiaki Ishikawa, Bill
Gianopoulos, Benoit Jacob, Gary Kwong, Robert O'Callahan, Jesse Ruderman,
and Julian Seward discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting
Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an
attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via
application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the
user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-0769, CVE-2013-0749, CVE-2013-0770)

Abhishek Arya discovered several user-after-free and buffer overflows in
Firefox. An attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service via
application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the
user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-0760, CVE-2013-0761, CVE-2013-0762,
CVE-2013-0763, CVE-2013-0766, CVE-2013-0767, CVE-2013-0771, CVE-2012-5829)

A stack buffer was discovered in Firefox. If the user were tricked into
opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this
to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute
code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-0768)

Masato Kinugawa discovered that Firefox did not always properly display URL
values in the address bar. A remote attacker could exploit this to conduct
URL spoofing and phishing attacks. (CVE-2013-0759)

Atte Kettunen discovered that Firefox did not properly handle HTML tables
with a large number of columns and column groups. If the user were tricked
into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit this to
cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute
code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-0744)

Jerry Baker discovered that Firefox did not always properly handle
threading when performing downloads over SSL connections. An attacker could
exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash.
(CVE-2013-0764)

Olli Pettay and Boris Zbarsky discovered flaws in the Javacript engine of
Firefox. An attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash,
or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking
Firefox. (CVE-2013-0745, CVE-2013-0746)

Jesse Ruderman discovered a flaw in the way Firefox handled plugins.  If a
user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, a remote attacker
could exploit this to bypass security protections to conduct clickjacking
attacks. (CVE-2013-0747)

Jesse Ruderman discovered an information leak in Firefox. An attacker could
exploit this to reveal memory address layout which could help in bypassing
ASLR protections. (CVE-2013-0748)

An integer overflow was discovered in the Javascript engine, leading to a
heap-based buffer overflow. If the user were tricked into opening a
specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to execute
code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-0750)

Sviatoslav Chagaev discovered that Firefox did not properly handle XBL
files with multiple XML bindings with SVG content. An attacker could cause
a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with
the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-0752)

Mariusz Mlynski discovered two flaws to gain access to privileged chrome
functions. An attacker could possibly exploit this to execute code with the
privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-0757, CVE-2013-0758)

Several use-after-free issues were discovered in Firefox. If the user were
tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly
exploit this to execute code with the privileges of the user invoking
Firefox. (CVE-2013-0753, CVE-2013-0754, CVE-2013-0755, CVE-2013-0756)

Two intermediate CA certificates were mis-issued by the TURKTRUST
certificate authority. If a remote attacker were able to perform a
man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive
information. (CVE-2013-0743)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.10:
  firefox                         18.0+build1-0ubuntu0.12.10.3

Message-ID: <50F51737.4050702@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1688-1
January 15, 2013

linux-lts-backport-oneiric vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-lts-backport-oneiric: Linux kernel backport from Oneiric

Details:

Jon Howell reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel-based virtual
machine) subsystem's handling of the XSAVE feature. On hosts, using qemu
userspace, without the XSAVE feature an unprivileged local attacker could
exploit this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2012-4461)

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's handling of script execution
when module loading is enabled. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to
cause a leak of kernel stack contents. (CVE-2012-4530)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.0.0-30-generic    3.0.0-30.47~lucid1
  linux-image-3.0.0-30-generic-pae  3.0.0-30.47~lucid1
  linux-image-3.0.0-30-server     3.0.0-30.47~lucid1
  linux-image-3.0.0-30-virtual    3.0.0-30.47~lucid1

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1695-1
January 17, 2013

rpm vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

RPM could be made to crash or run programs if it opened a specially crafted
package file.

Software Description:
- rpm: package manager for RPM

Details:

It was discovered that RPM incorrectly handled certain package headers. If
a user or automated system were tricked into installing a specially crafted
RPM package, an attacker could cause RPM to crash, resulting in a denial of
service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  rpm                             4.9.1.1-1ubuntu0.1

Ubuntu 11.10:
  rpm                             4.9.0-7ubuntu0.1

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  rpm                             4.7.2-1lubuntu0.1

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1696-1
January 18, 2013

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Jon Howell reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel-based virtual
machine) subsystem's handling of the XSAVE CPU feature. On hosts without the
XSAVE CPU feature, using qemu userspace, an unprivileged local attacker could
exploit this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2012-4461)

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's handling of script execution
when module loading is enabled. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to
cause a leak of kernel stack contents. (CVE-2012-4530)

Florian Weimer discovered that hypervkvpd, which is distributed in the
Linux kernel, was not correctly validating source addresses of netlink
packets. An untrusted local user can cause a denial of service by causing
hypervkvpd to exit. (CVE-2012-5532)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.2.0-36-generic    3.2.0-36.57
  linux-image-3.2.0-36-generic-pae  3.2.0-36.57
  linux-image-3.2.0-36-highbank   3.2.0-36.57
  linux-image-3.2.0-36-omap       3.2.0-36.57
  linux-image-3.2.0-36-powerpc-smp  3.2.0-36.57
  linux-image-3.2.0-36-powerpc64-smp  3.2.0-36.57
  linux-image-3.2.0-36-virtual    3.2.0-36.57

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

firefox regression
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.10
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

USN-1681-1 introduced a regression in Firefox.

Software Description:
- firefox: Mozilla Open Source web browser

Details:

USN-1681-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. Due to an upstream regression,
some translations became unusable after upgrading. This update fixes the
problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Mats Palmgren, Chiaki Ishikawa, Bill
 Gianopoulos, Benoit Jacob, Gary Kwong, Robert O'Callahan, Jesse Ruderman,
 and Julian Seward discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting
 Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an
 attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via
 application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the
 user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-0769, CVE-2013-0749, CVE-2013-0770)

 Abhishek Arya discovered several user-after-free and buffer overflows in
 Firefox. An attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service via
 application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the
 user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-0760, CVE-2013-0761, CVE-2013-0762,
 CVE-2013-0763, CVE-2013-0766, CVE-2013-0767, CVE-2013-0771, CVE-2012-5829)

 A stack buffer was discovered in Firefox. If the user were tricked into
 opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this
 to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute
 code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-0768)

 Masato Kinugawa discovered that Firefox did not always properly display URL
 values in the address bar. A remote attacker could exploit this to conduct
 URL spoofing and phishing attacks. (CVE-2013-0759)

 Atte Kettunen discovered that Firefox did not properly handle HTML tables
 with a large number of columns and column groups. If the user were tricked
 into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit this to
 cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute
 code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-0744)

 Jerry Baker discovered that Firefox did not always properly handle
 threading when performing downloads over SSL connections. An attacker could
 exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash.
 (CVE-2013-0764)

 Olli Pettay and Boris Zbarsky discovered flaws in the Javacript engine of
 Firefox. An attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash,
 or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking
 Firefox. (CVE-2013-0745, CVE-2013-0746)

 Jesse Ruderman discovered a flaw in the way Firefox handled plugins.  If a
 user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, a remote attacker
 could exploit this to bypass security protections to conduct clickjacking
 attacks. (CVE-2013-0747)

 Jesse Ruderman discovered an information leak in Firefox. An attacker could
 exploit this to reveal memory address layout which could help in bypassing
 ASLR protections. (CVE-2013-0748)

 An integer overflow was discovered in the Javascript engine, leading to a
 heap-based buffer overflow. If the user were tricked into opening a
 specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to execute
 code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-0750)

 Sviatoslav Chagaev discovered that Firefox did not properly handle XBL
 files with multiple XML bindings with SVG content. An attacker could cause
 a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with
 the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-0752)

 Mariusz Mlynski discovered two flaws to gain access to privileged chrome
 functions. An attacker could possibly exploit this to execute code with the
 privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-0757, CVE-2013-0758)

 Several use-after-free issues were discovered in Firefox. If the user were
 tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly
 exploit this to execute code with the privileges of the user invoking
 Firefox. (CVE-2013-0753, CVE-2013-0754, CVE-2013-0755, CVE-2013-0756)

 Two intermediate CA certificates were mis-issued by the TURKTRUST
 certificate authority. If a remote attacker were able to perform a
 man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive
 information. (CVE-2013-0743)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:
