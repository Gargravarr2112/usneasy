Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1494-1
July 02, 2012

linux-ti-omap4 vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

The system could be made to crash if it received specially crafted network
traffic.

Software Description:
- linux-ti-omap4: Linux kernel for OMAP4

Details:

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's NFSv4 (Network file system)
handling of ACLs (access control lists). A remote NFS server (attacker)
could cause a denial of service (OOPS).

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.2.0-1415-omap4    3.2.0-1415.20

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in OpenJDK 6.

Software Description:
- openjdk-6: Open Source Java implementation
- icedtea-web: A web browser plugin to execute Java applets

Details:

It was discovered that multiple flaws existed in the CORBA (Common
Object Request Broker Architecture) implementation in OpenJDK. An
attacker could create a Java application or applet that used these
flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions or modify immutable object
data. (CVE-2012-1711, CVE-2012-1719)

It was discovered that multiple flaws existed in the OpenJDK font
manager's layout lookup implementation. A attacker could specially
craft a font file that could cause a denial of service through
crashing the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) or possibly execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2012-1713)

It was discovered that the SynthLookAndFeel class from Swing in
OpenJDK did not properly prevent access to certain UI elements
from outside the current application context. An attacker could
create a Java application or applet that used this flaw to cause a
denial of service through crashing the JVM or bypass Java sandbox
restrictions. (CVE-2012-1716)

It was discovered that OpenJDK runtime library classes could create
temporary files with insecure permissions. A local attacker could
use this to gain access to sensitive information. (CVE-2012-1717)

It was discovered that OpenJDK did not handle CRLs (Certificate
Revocation Lists) properly. A remote attacker could use this to gain
access to sensitive information. (CVE-2012-1718)

It was discovered that the OpenJDK HotSpot Virtual Machine did not
properly verify the bytecode of the class to be executed. A remote
attacker could create a Java application or applet that used this
to cause a denial of service through crashing the JVM or bypass Java
sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2012-1723, CVE-2012-1725)

It was discovered that the OpenJDK XML (Extensible Markup Language)
parser did not properly handle some XML documents. An attacker could
create an XML document that caused a denial of service in a Java
application or applet parsing the document. (CVE-2012-1724)

As part of this update, the IcedTea web browser applet plugin was
updated for Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 11.04, and Ubuntu 11.10.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  openjdk-6-jre                   6b24-1.11.3-1ubuntu0.12.04.1

Ubuntu 11.10:

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1507-1
July 17, 2012

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) virtual
cpu setup. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to crash the
system leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2012-1601)

An error was found in the Linux kernel's IPv6 netfilter when connection
tracking is enabled. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to crash a
system if it is using IPv6 with the nf_contrack_ipv6 kernel module loaded.
(CVE-2012-2744)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.24-32-386       2.6.24-32.104
  linux-image-2.6.24-32-generic   2.6.24-32.104

  linux-image-2.6.24-32-lpia      2.6.24-32.104
  linux-image-2.6.24-32-lpiacompat  2.6.24-32.104
  linux-image-2.6.24-32-mckinley  2.6.24-32.104
  linux-image-2.6.24-32-openvz    2.6.24-32.104
  linux-image-2.6.24-32-powerpc   2.6.24-32.104
  linux-image-2.6.24-32-powerpc-smp  2.6.24-32.104
  linux-image-2.6.24-32-powerpc64-smp  2.6.24-32.104

  linux-image-2.6.24-32-xen       2.6.24-32.104

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

The system could be made to crash under certain conditions.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

An error was discovered in the Linux kernel's memory subsystem (hugetlb).
An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of
service (crash the system).

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.2.0-27-generic    3.2.0-27.43
  linux-image-3.2.0-27-generic-pae  3.2.0-27.43
  linux-image-3.2.0-27-highbank   3.2.0-27.43
  linux-image-3.2.0-27-omap       3.2.0-27.43
  linux-image-3.2.0-27-powerpc-smp  3.2.0-27.43
  linux-image-3.2.0-27-powerpc64-smp  3.2.0-27.43
  linux-image-3.2.0-27-virtual    3.2.0-27.43

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.
