Message-ID: <510BA9AD.2010906@canonical.com>

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1699-2
February 01, 2013

linux regression
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.10

Summary:

USN-1699-1 introduced a regression in the Linux kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

USN-1699-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel. Due to an unrelated
regression inotify/fanotify stopped working after upgrading. This update
fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Jon Howell reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel-based virtual
 machine) subsystem's handling of the XSAVE CPU feature. On hosts without the
 XSAVE CPU feature, using qemu userspace, an unprivileged local attacker could
 exploit this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2012-4461)
 
 A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's handling of script execution
 when module loading is enabled. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to
 cause a leak of kernel stack contents. (CVE-2012-4530)
 
 Florian Weimer discovered that hypervkvpd, which is distributed in the
 Linux kernel, was not correctly validating source addresses of netlink
 packets. An untrusted local user can cause a denial of service by causing
 hypervkvpd to exit. (CVE-2012-5532)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.10:
  linux-image-3.5.0-23-generic    3.5.0-23.35
  linux-image-3.5.0-23-highbank   3.5.0-23.35
  linux-image-3.5.0-23-omap       3.5.0-23.35
  linux-image-3.5.0-23-powerpc-smp  3.5.0-23.35
  linux-image-3.5.0-23-powerpc64-smp  3.5.0-23.35

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.10
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

USN-1681-1 introduced a regression in Firefox.

Software Description:
- firefox: Mozilla Open Source web browser

Details:

USN-1681-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. Due to an upstream regression,
Firefox suffered from instabilities when accessing some websites. This
update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Mats Palmgren, Chiaki Ishikawa, Bill
 Gianopoulos, Benoit Jacob, Gary Kwong, Robert O'Callahan, Jesse Ruderman,
 and Julian Seward discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting
 Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an
 attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via
 application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the
 user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-0769, CVE-2013-0749, CVE-2013-0770)

 Abhishek Arya discovered several user-after-free and buffer overflows in
 Firefox. An attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service via
 application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the
 user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-0760, CVE-2013-0761, CVE-2013-0762,
 CVE-2013-0763, CVE-2013-0766, CVE-2013-0767, CVE-2013-0771, CVE-2012-5829)

 A stack buffer was discovered in Firefox. If the user were tricked into
 opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this
 to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute
 code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-0768)

 Masato Kinugawa discovered that Firefox did not always properly display URL
 values in the address bar. A remote attacker could exploit this to conduct
 URL spoofing and phishing attacks. (CVE-2013-0759)

 Atte Kettunen discovered that Firefox did not properly handle HTML tables
 with a large number of columns and column groups. If the user were tricked
 into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit this to
 cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute
 code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-0744)

 Jerry Baker discovered that Firefox did not always properly handle
 threading when performing downloads over SSL connections. An attacker could
 exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash.

 Firefox. An attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash,
 or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking
 Firefox. (CVE-2013-0745, CVE-2013-0746)

 Jesse Ruderman discovered a flaw in the way Firefox handled plugins.  If a
 user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, a remote attacker
 could exploit this to bypass security protections to conduct clickjacking
 attacks. (CVE-2013-0747)

 Jesse Ruderman discovered an information leak in Firefox. An attacker could
 exploit this to reveal memory address layout which could help in bypassing
 ASLR protections. (CVE-2013-0748)

 An integer overflow was discovered in the Javascript engine, leading to a
 heap-based buffer overflow. If the user were tricked into opening a
 specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to execute
 code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-0750)

 Sviatoslav Chagaev discovered that Firefox did not properly handle XBL
 files with multiple XML bindings with SVG content. An attacker could cause
 a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with
 the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-0752)

 Mariusz Mlynski discovered two flaws to gain access to privileged chrome
 functions. An attacker could possibly exploit this to execute code with the
 privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-0757, CVE-2013-0758)

 Several use-after-free issues were discovered in Firefox. If the user were
 tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly
 exploit this to execute code with the privileges of the user invoking
 Firefox. (CVE-2013-0753, CVE-2013-0754, CVE-2013-0755, CVE-2013-0756)

 Two intermediate CA certificates were mis-issued by the TURKTRUST
 certificate authority. If a remote attacker were able to perform a
 man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive
 information. (CVE-2013-0743)

Message-ID: <511A8870.6060908@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1719-1
February 12, 2013

linux-lts-backport-oneiric vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-lts-backport-oneiric: Linux kernel backport from Oneiric

Details:

It was discovered that hypervkvpd, which is distributed in the Linux
kernel, was not correctly validating the origin on Netlink messages. An
untrusted local user can cause a denial of service of Linux guests in
Hyper-V virtualization environments. (CVE-2012-2669)

Dmitry Monakhov reported a race condition flaw the Linux ext4 filesystem
that can expose stale data. An unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to
cause an information leak. (CVE-2012-4508)

Andrew Cooper of Citrix reported a Xen stack corruption in the Linux
kernel. An unprivileged user in a 32bit PVOPS guest can cause the guest
kernel to crash, or operate erroneously. (CVE-2013-0190)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.0.0-31-generic    3.0.0-31.48~lucid1
  linux-image-3.0.0-31-generic-pae  3.0.0-31.48~lucid1
  linux-image-3.0.0-31-server     3.0.0-31.48~lucid1
  linux-image-3.0.0-31-virtual    3.0.0-31.48~lucid1

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1721-1
February 12, 2013

curl vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.10

Summary:

curl could be made to crash or run programs if it opened a malicious URL.

Software Description:
- curl: HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP client and client libraries

Details:

It was discovered that curl incorrectly handled SASL authentication when
communicating over POP3, SMTP or IMAP. If a user or automated system were
tricked into processing a specially crafted URL, an attacker could cause
a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. The default
compiler options for affected releases should reduce the vulnerability to a
denial of service.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.10:
  libcurl3                        7.27.0-1ubuntu1.1
  libcurl3-gnutls                 7.27.0-1ubuntu1.1

- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

jQuery could be made to expose sensitive information over the network.

Software Description:

Details:

It was discovered that jQuery incorrectly handled selecting elements using
location.hash, resulting in a possible cross-site scripting (XSS) issue.
With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into
viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to
modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  libjs-jquery                    1.6.2-1ubuntu2.2

Subject: [USN-1726-1] Linux kernel (OMAP4) vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <511D7B22.2010500@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1726-1
February 14, 2013

linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-ti-omap4: Linux kernel for OMAP4

Details:

It was discovered that hypervkvpd, which is distributed in the Linux
kernel, was not correctly validating the origin on Netlink messages. An
untrusted local user can cause a denial of service of Linux guests in
Hyper-V virtualization environments. (CVE-2012-2669)

Dmitry Monakhov reported a race condition flaw the Linux ext4 filesystem
that can expose stale data. An unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to
cause an information leak. (CVE-2012-4508)

Florian Weimer discovered that hypervkvpd, which is distributed in the
Linux kernel, was not correctly validating source addresses of netlink
packets. An untrusted local user can cause a denial of service by causing
hypervkvpd to exit. (CVE-2012-5532)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  linux-image-3.0.0-1221-omap4    3.0.0-1221.34

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

February 21, 2013

ruby1.9.1 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.10
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in Ruby.

Software Description:
- ruby1.9.1: Interpreter of object-oriented scripting language Ruby

Details:

Jean-Philippe Aumasson discovered that Ruby incorrectly generated
predictable hash values. An attacker could use this issue to generate hash
collisions and cause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-5371)

Evgeny Ermakov discovered that documentation generated by rdoc is
vulnerable to a cross-site scripting issue. With cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted
page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal
confidential data, within the same domain. (CVE-2013-0256)

Thomas Hollstegge and Ben Murphy discovered that the JSON implementation
in Ruby incorrectly handled certain crafted documents. An attacker could
use this issue to cause a denial of service or bypass certain protection
mechanisms. (CVE-2013-0269)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.10:
  libruby1.9.1                    1.9.3.194-1ubuntu1.3
  ruby1.9.1                       1.9.3.194-1ubuntu1.3

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  libruby1.9.1                    1.9.3.0-1ubuntu2.5
  ruby1.9.1                       1.9.3.0-1ubuntu2.5

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

The system could be made to run programs as an administrator.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Suleiman Souhlal, Salman Qazi, Aaron Durbin and Michael Davidson discovered
a race condition in the Linux kernel's ptrace syscall. An unprivileged
local attacker could exploit this flaw to run programs as an administrator.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.2.0-38-generic    3.2.0-38.61
  linux-image-3.2.0-38-generic-pae  3.2.0-38.61
  linux-image-3.2.0-38-highbank   3.2.0-38.61
  linux-image-3.2.0-38-omap       3.2.0-38.61
  linux-image-3.2.0-38-powerpc-smp  3.2.0-38.61
  linux-image-3.2.0-38-powerpc64-smp  3.2.0-38.61
  linux-image-3.2.0-38-virtual    3.2.0-38.61

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

thunderbird vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.10
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird.

Software Description:
- thunderbird: Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

Details:

Bobby Holley discovered vulnerabilities in Chrome Object Wrappers (COW) and
System Only Wrappers (SOW). If a user were tricked into opening a specially
crafted page and had scripting enabled, a remote attacker could exploit
this to bypass security protections to obtain sensitive information or
potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking
Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-0773)

Frederik Braun discovered that Thunderbird made the location of the active
browser profile available to JavaScript workers. Scripting for Thunderbird
is disabled by default in Ubuntu. (CVE-2013-0774)

A use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in Thunderbird. An attacker
could potentially exploit this to execute code with the privileges of the
user invoking Thunderbird if scripting were enabled. (CVE-2013-0775)

Michal Zalewski discovered that Thunderbird would not always show the
correct address when cancelling a proxy authentication prompt. A remote
attacker could exploit this to conduct URL spoofing and phishing attacks
if scripting were enabled.
(CVE-2013-0776)

Abhishek Arya discovered several problems related to memory handling. If
the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker
could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application
crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking
Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-0777, CVE-2013-0778, CVE-2013-0779, CVE-2013-0780,
CVE-2013-0781, CVE-2013-0782)

Olli Pettay, Christoph Diehl, Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Andrew McCreight,
Joe Drew, Wayne Mery, Alon Zakai, Christian Holler, Gary Kwong, Luke
Wagner, Terrence Cole, Timothy Nikkel, Bill McCloskey, and Nicolas Pierron
discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting Thunderbird. If a user
had scripting enabled and was tricked into opening a specially crafted
page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service
via application crash. (CVE-2013-0783, CVE-2013-0784)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.10:
  thunderbird                     17.0.3+build1-0ubuntu0.12.10.1

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  thunderbird                     17.0.3+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1

Ubuntu 11.10:
  thunderbird                     17.0.3+build1-0ubuntu0.11.10.1

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  thunderbird                     17.0.3+build1-0ubuntu0.10.04.1

After a standard system update you need to restart Thunderbird to make all
the necessary changes.

Summary:

USN-1732-1 introduced a regression in OpenSSL.

Software Description:
- openssl: Secure Socket Layer (SSL) cryptographic library and tools

Details:

USN-1732-1 fixed vulnerabilities in OpenSSL. The fix for CVE-2013-0166 and
CVE-2012-2686 introduced a regression causing decryption failures on
hardware supporting AES-NI. This update temporarily reverts the security
fix pending further investigation. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Adam Langley and Wolfgang Ettlingers discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly
 handled certain crafted CBC data when used with AES-NI. A remote attacker
 could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of
 service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 12.10.
 (CVE-2012-2686)
  Nadhem Alfardan and Kenny Paterson discovered that the TLS protocol as
used
 in OpenSSL was vulnerable to a timing side-channel attack known as the
 "Lucky Thirteen" issue. A remote attacker could use this issue to perform
 plaintext-recovery attacks via analysis of timing data. (CVE-2013-0169)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.10:
  libssl1.0.0                     1.0.1c-3ubuntu2.2
  openssl                         1.0.1c-3ubuntu2.2

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
