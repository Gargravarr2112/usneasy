==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2677-1
August 04, 2015

oxide-qt vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 15.04
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in Oxide.

Software Description:
- oxide-qt: Web browser engine library for Qt (QML plugin)

Details:

An uninitialized value issue was discovered in ICU. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2015-1270)

A use-after-free was discovered in the GPU process implementation in
Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of
service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1272)

A use-after-free was discovered in the IndexedDB implementation in
Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of
service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1276)

A use-after-free was discovered in the accessibility implemetation in
Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of
service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1277)

A memory corruption issue was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked
in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially
exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process.
(CVE-2015-1280)

It was discovered that Blink did not properly determine the V8 context of
a microtask in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a
specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions. (CVE-2015-1281)

Multiple integer overflows were discovered in Expat. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application
crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
the program. (CVE-2015-1283)

It was discovered that Blink did not enforce a page's maximum number of 
frames in some circumstances, resulting in a use-after-free. If a user
were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash,
or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render
process. (CVE-2015-1284)

It was discovered that the XSS auditor in Blink did not properly choose a
truncation point. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive
information. (CVE-2015-1285)

An issue was discovered in the CSS implementation in Blink. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions.
(CVE-2015-1287)

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial
of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1289)

A use-after-free was discovered in oxide::qt::URLRequestDelegatedJob in
some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially
crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a
denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1329)

A crash was discovered in the regular expression implementation in V8 in
some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially
crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a
denial of service. (CVE-2015-5605)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.04:
  liboxideqtcore0                 1.8.4-0ubuntu0.15.04.1

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  liboxideqtcore0                 1.8.4-0ubuntu0.14.04.2

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
