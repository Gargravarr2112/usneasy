Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in Oxide.

Software Description:
- oxide-qt: Web browser engine library for Qt (QML plugin)

Details:

An uninitialized value issue was discovered in ICU. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2015-1270)

A use-after-free was discovered in the GPU process implementation in
Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of
service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1272)

A use-after-free was discovered in the IndexedDB implementation in
Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of
service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1276)

A use-after-free was discovered in the accessibility implemetation in
Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of
service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1277)

A memory corruption issue was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked
in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially
exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process.
(CVE-2015-1280)

It was discovered that Blink did not properly determine the V8 context of
a microtask in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a
specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions. (CVE-2015-1281)

Multiple integer overflows were discovered in Expat. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render
process. (CVE-2015-1284)

It was discovered that the XSS auditor in Blink did not properly choose a
truncation point. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive
information. (CVE-2015-1285)

An issue was discovered in the CSS implementation in Blink. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions.
(CVE-2015-1287)

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial
of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1289)

A use-after-free was discovered in oxide::qt::URLRequestDelegatedJob in
some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially
crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a
denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1329)

A crash was discovered in the regular expression implementation in V8 in
some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially
crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a
denial of service. (CVE-2015-5605)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 15.04:
  liboxideqtcore0                 1.8.4-0ubuntu0.15.04.1

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in OpenJDK 6.

Software Description:
- openjdk-6: Open Source Java implementation

Details:

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the OpenJDK JRE related to
information disclosure, data integrity, and availability. An attacker
could exploit these to cause a denial of service or expose sensitive
data over the network. (CVE-2015-2590, CVE-2015-2628, CVE-2015-4731,
CVE-2015-4732, CVE-2015-4733, CVE-2015-4760, CVE-2015-4748)

of the OpenJDK JRE. An attacker could exploit these to expose sensitive
data over the network. (CVE-2015-2601, CVE-2015-2808, CVE-2015-4000,
CVE-2015-2625, CVE-2015-2613)

As a security improvement, this update modifies OpenJDK behavior to
disable RC4 TLS/SSL cipher suites by default.

As a security improvement, this update modifies OpenJDK behavior to
reject DH key sizes below 768 bits by default, preventing a possible
downgrade attack.

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the OpenJDK JRE related
to information disclosure. An attacker could exploit these to expose
sensitive data over the network. (CVE-2015-2621, CVE-2015-2632)

A vulnerability was discovered with how the JNDI component of the
OpenJDK JRE handles DNS resolutions. A remote attacker could exploit
this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2015-4749)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  icedtea-6-jre-cacao             6b36-1.13.8-0ubuntu1~12.04
  icedtea-6-jre-jamvm             6b36-1.13.8-0ubuntu1~12.04
