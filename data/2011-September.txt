Subject: [USN-1197-1] Firefox and Xulrunner vulnerability
Message-ID: <4E5ED730.5090201@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1197-1
September 01, 2011

firefox, xulrunner-1.9.2 vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

A certificate authority issued fraudulent certificates.

Software Description:
- firefox: Mozilla Open Source web browser
- xulrunner-1.9.2: Mozilla Gecko runtime environment

Details:

It was discovered that Dutch Certificate Authority DigiNotar, had
mis-issued multiple fraudulent certificates. These certificates could allow
an attacker to perform a "man in the middle" (MITM) attack which would make
the user believe their connection is secure, but is actually being
monitored.

For the protection of its users, Mozilla has removed the DigiNotar
certificate. Sites using certificates issued by DigiNotar will need to seek
another certificate vendor.

We are currently aware of a regression that blocks one of two Staat der
Nederlanden root certificates which are believed to still be secure. This
regression is being tracked at https://launchpad.net/bugs/838322.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.04:
  firefox                         6.0.1+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.11.04.1

Ubuntu 10.10:
  firefox                         3.6.21+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.10.1
  xulrunner-1.9.2                 1.9.2.21+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.10.1

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  firefox                         3.6.21+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1
  xulrunner-1.9.2                 1.9.2.21+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Firefox and any
applications that use Xulrunner to effect the necessary changes.

Message-ID: <4E6088AF.3060704@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1197-2
September 02, 2011

thunderbird vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

A certificate authority issued fraudulent certificates.

Software Description:
- thunderbird: Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

Details:

USN-1197-1 fixed a vulnerability in Firefox with regard to the DigiNotar
certificate authority. This update provides the corresponding updates for
Thunderbird.

We are aware that the DigiNotar Root CA Certificate is still shown as
trusted in the Thunderbird certificate manager. This is due to Thunderbird
using the system version of the Network Security Service libraries (NSS).
Thunderbird will actively distrust any certificate signed by this DigiNotar
Root CA certificate. This means that users will still get an untrusted
certificate warning when accessing a service through Thunderbird that
presents a certificate signed by this DigiNotar Root CA certificate.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that Dutch Certificate Authority DigiNotar had
 mis-issued multiple fraudulent certificates. These certificates could allow
 an attacker to perform a "man in the middle" (MITM) attack which would make
 the user believe their connection is secure, but is actually being
 monitored.
 
 For the protection of its users, Mozilla has removed the DigiNotar
 certificate. Sites using certificates issued by DigiNotar will need to seek
 another certificate vendor.
 
 We are currently aware of a regression that blocks one of two Staat der
 Nederlanden root certificates which are believed to still be secure. This
 regression is being tracked at https://launchpad.net/bugs/838322.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.04:
  thunderbird                     3.1.13+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.11.04.1

Ubuntu 10.10:
  thunderbird                     3.1.13+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.10.1

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  thunderbird                     3.1.13+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1

After a standard system update you need to restart Thunderbird to make
all the necessary changes.

- Ubuntu 10.10

Summary:

Multiple kernel flaws have been fixed.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

It was discovered that the /proc filesystem did not correctly handle
permission changes when programs executed. A local attacker could hold open
files to examine details about programs running with higher privileges,
potentially increasing the chances of exploiting additional
vulnerabilities. (CVE-2011-1020)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the X.25 Rose network stack did not correctly
handle certain fields. If a system was running with Rose enabled, a remote
attacker could send specially crafted traffic to gain root privileges.
(CVE-2011-1493)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the DCCP stack did not correctly handle
certain packet structures. A remote attacker could exploit this to crash
the system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-1770)

package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-218-dove     2.6.32-218.36

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.31-610-imx51    2.6.31-610.28

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

qt4-x11 vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

A certificate authority mis-issued fraudulent certificates.

Software Description:
- qt4-x11: Qt 4 libraries and support modules

Details:

USN-1197-1 and USN-1197-3 addressed an issue in Firefox and Xulrunner
pertaining to the Dutch Certificate Authority DigiNotar mis-issuing
fraudulent certificates. This update provides an update
for Qt that blacklists the known fraudulent certificates.

Original advisory details:
 USN-1197-1

 It was discovered that Dutch Certificate Authority DigiNotar had
 mis-issued multiple fraudulent certificates. These certificates could allow
 an attacker to perform a "man in the middle" (MITM) attack which would make
 the user believe their connection is secure, but is actually being
 monitored.
 
 For the protection of its users, Mozilla has removed the DigiNotar
 certificate. Sites using certificates issued by DigiNotar will need to seek
 another certificate vendor.
 
 We are currently aware of a regression that blocks one of two Staat der
 Nederlanden root certificates which are believed to still be secure. This
 regression is being tracked at https://launchpad.net/bugs/838322.

 USN-1197-3

 USN-1197-1 partially addressed an issue with Dutch Certificate Authority
 DigiNotar mis-issuing fraudulent certificates. This update actively
 distrusts the DigiNotar root certificate as well as several intermediary
 certificates. Also included in this list of distrusted certificates are the
 "PKIOverheid" (PKIGovernment) intermediates under DigiNotar's control that
 did not chain to DigiNotar's root and were not previously blocked.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.04:
  libqt4-network                  4:4.7.2-0ubuntu6.3

Ubuntu 10.10:
  libqt4-network                  4:4.7.0-0ubuntu4.4

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  libqt4-network                  4:4.6.2-0ubuntu5.3

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart your session to effect
the necessary changes.

initialize structure memory. A local attacker could exploit this to read
portions of kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy.
(CVE-2010-4076, CVE-2010-4077)

Alex Shi and Eric Dumazet discovered that the network stack did not
correctly handle packet backlogs. A remote attacker could exploit this by
sending a large amount of network traffic to cause the system to run out of
memory, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4251, CVE-2010-4805)

It was discovered that the /proc filesystem did not correctly handle
permission changes when programs executed. A local attacker could hold open
files to examine details about programs running with higher privileges,
potentially increasing the chances of exploiting additional
vulnerabilities. (CVE-2011-1020)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the X.25 Rose network stack did not correctly
handle certain fields. If a system was running with Rose enabled, a remote
attacker could send specially crafted traffic to gain root privileges.
(CVE-2011-1493)

Timo Warns discovered that the GUID partition parsing routines did not
correctly validate certain structures. A local attacker with physical
access could plug in a specially crafted block device to crash the system,
leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-1577)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the IPv4 diagnostic routines did not
correctly validate certain requests. A local attacker could exploit this to
consume CPU resources, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2213)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that taskstats listeners were not correctly
handled. A local attacker could expoit this to exhaust memory and CPU
resources, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2484)

It was discovered that Bluetooth l2cap and rfcomm did not correctly
initialize structures. A local attacker could exploit this to read portions
of the kernel stack, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-2492)

Mauro Carvalho Chehab discovered that the si4713 radio driver did not
correctly check the length of memory copies. If this hardware was
available, a local attacker could exploit this to crash the system or gain
root privileges. (CVE-2011-2700)

Herbert Xu discovered that certain fields were incorrectly handled when
Generic Receive Offload (CVE-2011-2723)

The performance counter subsystem did not correctly handle certain
counters. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading
to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2918)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-318-ec2      2.6.32-318.38

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1210-1
September 28, 2011

firefox, xulrunner-1.9.2 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been fixed in Firefox and Xulrunner.

Software Description:
- firefox: Mozilla Open Source web browser
- xulrunner-1.9.2: Mozilla Gecko runtime environment

Details:

Benjamin Smedberg, Bob Clary, Jesse Ruderman, and Josh Aas discovered
multiple memory vulnerabilities in the browser rendering engine. An
attacker could use these to possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2011-2995, CVE-2011-2996)

Boris Zbarsky discovered that a frame named "location" could shadow the
window.location object unless a script in a page grabbed a reference to the
true object before the frame was created. This is in violation of the Same
Origin Policy. A malicious website could possibly use this to access
another website or the local file system. (CVE-2011-2999)

Mark Kaplan discovered an integer underflow in the SpiderMonkey JavaScript
engine. An attacker could potentially use this to crash Firefox.

Ian Graham discovered that when multiple Location headers were present,
Firefox would use the second one resulting in a possible CRLF injection
attack. CRLF injection issues can result in a wide variety of attacks, such
as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities, browser cache poisoning, and
cookie theft. (CVE-2011-3000)

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that if the user could be convinced to hold down
the enter key, a malicious website could potential pop up a download dialog
and the default open action would be selected. This would result in
potentially malicious content being run with privileges of the user
invoking Firefox. (CVE-2011-2372)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.10:
  firefox                         3.6.23+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.10.1
  xulrunner-1.9.2                 1.9.2.23+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.10.1

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  firefox                         3.6.23+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1
  xulrunner-1.9.2                 1.9.2.23+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Firefox and any
applications that use Xulrunner to effect the necessary changes.

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Multiple kernel flaws have been fixed.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Dan Rosenberg discovered that multiple terminal ioctls did not correctly
initialize structure memory. A local attacker could exploit this to read
portions of kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy.
(CVE-2010-4076, CVE-2010-4077)

Alex Shi and Eric Dumazet discovered that the network stack did not
correctly handle packet backlogs. A remote attacker could exploit this by
sending a large amount of network traffic to cause the system to run out of
memory, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4251, CVE-2010-4805)

It was discovered that the /proc filesystem did not correctly handle
permission changes when programs executed. A local attacker could hold open
files to examine details about programs running with higher privileges,
potentially increasing the chances of exploiting additional
vulnerabilities. (CVE-2011-1020)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the X.25 Rose network stack did not correctly
handle certain fields. If a system was running with Rose enabled, a remote
attacker could send specially crafted traffic to gain root privileges.
(CVE-2011-1493)

Timo Warns discovered that the GUID partition parsing routines did not
correctly validate certain structures. A local attacker with physical
access could plug in a specially crafted block device to crash the system,
leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-1577)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the IPv4 diagnostic routines did not
correctly validate certain requests. A local attacker could exploit this to
consume CPU resources, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2213)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that taskstats listeners were not correctly
handled. A local attacker could expoit this to exhaust memory and CPU
resources, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2484)

It was discovered that Bluetooth l2cap and rfcomm did not correctly
initialize structures. A local attacker could exploit this to read portions
of the kernel stack, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-2492)

Mauro Carvalho Chehab discovered that the si4713 radio driver did not
correctly check the length of memory copies. If this hardware was
available, a local attacker could exploit this to crash the system or gain
root privileges. (CVE-2011-2700)

Herbert Xu discovered that certain fields were incorrectly handled when
Generic Receive Offload (CVE-2011-2723)

The performance counter subsystem did not correctly handle certain
counters. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading
to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2918)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-34-386       2.6.32-34.77
  linux-image-2.6.32-34-generic   2.6.32-34.77
  linux-image-2.6.32-34-generic-pae  2.6.32-34.77
  linux-image-2.6.32-34-ia64      2.6.32-34.77
  linux-image-2.6.32-34-lpia      2.6.32-34.77
  linux-image-2.6.32-34-powerpc   2.6.32-34.77
  linux-image-2.6.32-34-powerpc-smp  2.6.32-34.77
  linux-image-2.6.32-34-powerpc64-smp  2.6.32-34.77
  linux-image-2.6.32-34-preempt   2.6.32-34.77
  linux-image-2.6.32-34-server    2.6.32-34.77
  linux-image-2.6.32-34-sparc64   2.6.32-34.77
  linux-image-2.6.32-34-sparc64-smp  2.6.32-34.77
  linux-image-2.6.32-34-versatile  2.6.32-34.77
  linux-image-2.6.32-34-virtual   2.6.32-34.77

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

filesystems. A local attacker could exploit this with a malformed Be
filesystem and crash the system, leading to a denial of service.
(CVE-2011-2928)

Darren Lavender discovered that the CIFS client incorrectly handled certain
large values. A remote attacker with a malicious server could exploit this
to crash the system or possibly execute arbitrary code as the root user.
(CVE-2011-3191)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.35-30-generic   2.6.35-30.60~lucid1

Subject: [USN-1221-1] Mutt vulnerability
Message-ID: <20110929235726.GC15933@boyd>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1221-1
September 29, 2011

mutt vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

An attacker could trick mutt into trusting a rogue server.

Software Description:
- mutt: text-based mailreader supporting MIME, GPG, PGP and threading

Details:

It was discovered that mutt incorrectly verified the hostname in an SSL
certificate. An attacker could trick mutt into trusting a rogue SMTPS,
IMAPS, or POP3S server's certificate, which was signed by a trusted certificate
authority, to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.04:
  mutt                            1.5.21-2ubuntu3.1
  mutt-patched                    1.5.21-2ubuntu3.1

Ubuntu 10.10:
  mutt                            1.5.20-9ubuntu2.1
  mutt-patched                    1.5.20-9ubuntu2.1

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  mutt                            1.5.20-7ubuntu1.1
  mutt-patched                    1.5.20-7ubuntu1.1

After a standard system update you need to restart mutt to make
all the necessary changes. Users are encouraged to verify their
~/.mutt_certificates file to ensure only trusted certificates are listed.

Firefox vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.04

Summary:

Firefox could be made to crash or possibly run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

Software Description:
- firefox: Mozilla Open Source web browser

Details:

Benjamin Smedberg, Bob Clary, Jesse Ruderman, Bob Clary, Andrew McCreight,
Andreas Gal, Gary Kwong, Igor Bukanov, Jason Orendorff, Jesse Ruderman, and
Marcia Knous discovered multiple memory vulnerabilities in the browser
rendering engine. An attacker could use these to possibly execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2011-2995,
CVE-2011-2997)

Boris Zbarsky discovered that a frame named "location" could shadow the
window.location object unless a script in a page grabbed a reference to the
true object before the frame was created. This is in violation of the Same
Origin Policy. A malicious website could possibly use this to access
another website or the local file system. (CVE-2011-2999)

Ian Graham discovered that when multiple Location headers were present,
Firefox would use the second one resulting in a possible CRLF injection
attack. CRLF injection issues can result in a wide variety of attacks, such
as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities, browser cache poisoning, and
cookie theft. (CVE-2011-3000)

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that if the user could be convinced to hold down
the enter key, a malicious website could potential pop up a download dialog
and the default open action would be selected or lead to the installation
of an arbitrary add-on. This would result in potentially malicious content
being run with privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2011-2372,
CVE-2011-3001)

Michael Jordon and Ben Hawkes discovered flaws in WebGL. If a user were
tricked into opening a malicious page, an attacker could cause the browser
to crash. (CVE-2011-3002, CVE-2011-3003)

It was discovered that Firefox did not properly free memory when processing
ogg files. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious page, an
attacker could cause the browser to crash. (CVE-2011-3005)

David Rees and Aki Helin discovered a problems in the JavaScript engine. An
attacker could exploit this to crash the browser or potentially escalate
privileges within the browser. (CVE-2011-3232)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.04:
  firefox                         7.0.1+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.11.04.1

After a standard system update you need to restart Firefox to make all the
necessary changes.
