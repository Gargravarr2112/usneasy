gnupg, libgcrypt11 vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 13.04
- Ubuntu 12.10
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

GnuPG and Libgcrypt could be made to expose sensitive information.

Software Description:
- gnupg: GNU privacy guard - a free PGP replacement

Details:

Yuval Yarom and Katrina Falkner discovered a timing-based information leak,
known as Flush+Reload, that could be used to trace execution in programs.
GnuPG and Libgcrypt followed different execution paths based on key-related
data, which could be used to expose the contents of private keys.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 13.04:
  gnupg                           1.4.12-7ubuntu1.1
  libgcrypt11                     1.5.0-3ubuntu2.2

Ubuntu 12.10:
  gnupg                           1.4.11-3ubuntu4.2
  libgcrypt11                     1.5.0-3ubuntu1.1

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  gnupg                           1.4.11-3ubuntu2.3

Subject: [USN-1929-1] Linux kernel vulnerability
Message-ID: <5213600C.2050706@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1929-1
August 20, 2013

linux vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

The system could be made to expose sensitive information.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's fanotify
interface. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive
information from kernel memory.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.2.0-52-generic    3.2.0-52.78
  linux-image-3.2.0-52-generic-pae  3.2.0-52.78
  linux-image-3.2.0-52-highbank   3.2.0-52.78
  linux-image-3.2.0-52-omap       3.2.0-52.78
  linux-image-3.2.0-52-powerpc-smp  3.2.0-52.78
  linux-image-3.2.0-52-powerpc64-smp  3.2.0-52.78
  linux-image-3.2.0-52-virtual    3.2.0-52.78

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

Subject: [USN-1930-1] Linux kernel (OMAP4) vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <52136023.8010801@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1930-1
August 20, 2013

linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-ti-omap4: Linux kernel for OMAP4

Details:

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's fanotify
interface. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive
information from kernel memory. (CVE-2013-2148)

Kees Cook discovered a format string vulnerability in the Broadcom B43
wireless driver for the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw
to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2013-2852)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.2.0-1436-omap4    3.2.0-1436.55

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-ti-omap4: Linux kernel for OMAP4

Details:

Chanam Park reported a Null pointer flaw in the Linux kernel's Ceph client.
A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2013-1059)

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's fanotify
interface. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive
information from kernel memory. (CVE-2013-2148)

Kees Cook discovered a format string vulnerability in the Linux kernel's
disk block layer. A local user with administrator privileges could exploit
this flaw to gain kernel privileges. (CVE-2013-2851)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 13.04:
  linux-image-3.5.0-231-omap4     3.5.0-231.47

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
