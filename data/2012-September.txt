Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1552-1
September 03, 2012

keystone vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Two security issues were fixed in OpenStack Keystone.

Software Description:
- keystone: OpenStack identity service

Details:

Dolph Mathews discovered that OpenStack Keystone did not properly
restrict to administrative users the ability to update users'
tenants. A remote attacker that can reach the administrative API can
use this to add any user to any tenant. (CVE-2012-3542)

Derek Higgins discovered that OpenStack Keystone did not properly
implement token expiration. A remote attacker could use this to
continue to access an account that has been disabled or has a changed
password. (CVE-2012-3426)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  keystone                        2012.1+stable~20120824-a16a0ab9-0ubuntu2.1
  python-keystone                 2012.1+stable~20120824-a16a0ab9-0ubuntu2.1

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

openjdk-6 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Two security issues were fixed in OpenJDK 6.

Software Description:
- openjdk-6: Open Source Java implementation

Details:

It was discovered that the Beans component in OpenJDK 6 did not
properly prevent access to restricted classes. A remote attacker could
use this to create an untrusted Java applet or application that would
bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2012-1682)

It was discovered that functionality in the AWT component in OpenJDK 6
made it easier for a remote attacker, in conjunction with other
vulnerabilities, to bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2012-0547)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Subject: [USN-1554-1] Linux kernel vulnerability
Message-ID: <50474291.4050409@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1554-1
September 05, 2012

linux vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10

Summary:

The system could be made to crash under certain conditions.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS)
protocol implementation. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to
cause a denial of service.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  linux-image-3.0.0-25-generic    3.0.0-25.41
  linux-image-3.0.0-25-generic-pae  3.0.0-25.41
  linux-image-3.0.0-25-omap       3.0.0-25.41
  linux-image-3.0.0-25-powerpc    3.0.0-25.41
  linux-image-3.0.0-25-powerpc-smp  3.0.0-25.41
  linux-image-3.0.0-25-powerpc64-smp  3.0.0-25.41
  linux-image-3.0.0-25-server     3.0.0-25.41
  linux-image-3.0.0-25-virtual    3.0.0-25.41

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

XML-RPC for C and C++ could be made to cause a denial of service by consuming
excessive CPU and memory resources.

Software Description:
- xmlrpc-c: Lightweight RPC library based on XML and HTTP

Details:

USN-1527-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Expat. This update provides the
corresponding updates for XML-RPC for C and C++. Both issues described in the
original advisory affected XML-RPC for C and C++ in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, 11.04,
11.10 and 12.04 LTS.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that Expat computed hash values without restricting the

 linked against Expat were tricked into opening a crafted XML file, an attacker
 could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive CPU resources.
 (CVE-2012-0876)
 
 Tim Boddy discovered that Expat did not properly handle memory reallocation
 when processing XML files. If a user or application linked against Expat were
 tricked into opening a crafted XML file, an attacker could cause a denial of
 service by consuming excessive memory resources. This issue only affected
 Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, 10.04 LTS, 11.04 and 11.10. (CVE-2012-1148)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  libxmlrpc-core-c3               1.16.33-3.1ubuntu5.1

September 10, 2012

linux-lts-backport-oneiric vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

The system could be made to crash under certain conditions.

Software Description:
- linux-lts-backport-oneiric: Linux kernel backport from Oneiric

Details:

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS)
protocol implementation. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to
cause a denial of service.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.0.0-25-generic    3.0.0-25.41~lucid1
  linux-image-3.0.0-25-generic-pae  3.0.0-25.41~lucid1
  linux-image-3.0.0-25-server     3.0.0-25.41~lucid1
  linux-image-3.0.0-25-virtual    3.0.0-25.41~lucid1

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

browser cache. This update fixes the problem.

Original advisory details:

 Gary Kwong, Christian Holler, Jesse Ruderman, Steve Fink, Bob Clary, Andrew
 Sutherland, Jason Smith, John Schoenick, Vladimir Vukicevic and Daniel
 Holbert discovered memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were
 tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit
 these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially
 execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.
 (CVE-2012-1970, CVE-2012-1971)
 
 Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities. If the
 user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could
 exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or
 potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.
 (CVE-2012-1972, CVE-2012-1973, CVE-2012-1974, CVE-2012-1975, CVE-2012-1976,
 CVE-2012-3956, CVE-2012-3957, CVE-2012-3958, CVE-2012-3959, CVE-2012-3960,

 Mariusz Mlynsk discovered that it is possible to shadow the location object
 using Object.defineProperty. This could potentially result in a cross-site
 scripting (XSS) attack against plugins. With cross-site scripting
 vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted
 page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents or steal
 confidential data within the same domain. (CVE-2012-1956)
 
 Mariusz Mlynski discovered an escalation of privilege vulnerability through
 about:newtab. This could possibly lead to potentially code execution with
 the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-3965)
 
 Fr?d?ric Hoguin discovered that bitmap format images with a negative height
 could potentially result in memory corruption. If the user were tricked
 into opening a specially crafted image, an attacker could exploit
 this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially
 execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.
 (CVE-2012-3966)
 
 It was discovered that Firefox's WebGL implementation was vulnerable to
 multiple memory safety issues. If the user were tricked into opening a
 specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit these to cause a denial
 of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the
 privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-3967, CVE-2012-3968)

 CVE-2012-3970)
 
 Christoph Diehl discovered multiple memory safety issues in the bundled
 Graphite 2 library. If the user were tricked into opening a specially
 crafted page, an attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service
 via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of
 the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-3971)
 
 Nicolas Gr?goire discovered an out-of-bounds read in the format-number
 feature of XSLT. This could potentially cause inaccurate formatting of
 numbers and information leakage. (CVE-2012-3972)
 
 Mark Goodwin discovered that under certain circumstances, Firefox's
 developer tools could allow remote debugging even when disabled.
 (CVE-2012-3973)
 
 It was discovered that when the DOMParser is used to parse text/html data
 in a Firefox extension, linked resources within this HTML data will be
 loaded. If the data being parsed in the extension is untrusted, it could
 lead to information leakage and potentially be combined with other attacks
 to become exploitable. (CVE-2012-3975)
 
 Mark Poticha discovered that under certain circumstances incorrect SSL
 certificate information can be displayed on the addressbar, showing the SSL
 data for a previous site while another has been loaded. This could
 potentially be used for phishing attacks. (CVE-2012-3976)
 
 It was discovered that, in some instances, certain security checks in the
 location object could be bypassed. This could allow for the loading of
 restricted content and can potentially be combined with other issues to
 become exploitable. (CVE-2012-3978)
 
 Colby Russell discovered that eval in the web console can execute injected
 code with chrome privileges, leading to the running of malicious code in a
 privileged context. If the user were tricked into opening a specially
 crafted page, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service
 via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of
 the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-3980)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Subject: [USN-1567-1] Linux kernel vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <50536CE3.8080004@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1567-1
September 14, 2012

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.04

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

A flaw was found in how the Linux kernel passed the replacement session
keyring to a child process. An unprivileged local user could exploit this
flaw to cause a denial of service (panic). (CVE-2012-2745)

Ben Hutchings reported a flaw in the Linux kernel with some network drivers
that support TSO (TCP segment offload). A local or peer user could exploit
this flaw to to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-3412)

Jay Fenlason and Doug Ledford discovered a bug in the Linux kernel
implementation of RDS sockets. A local unprivileged user could potentially
use this flaw to read privileged information from the kernel.
(CVE-2012-3430)

A flaw was discovered in the madvise feature of the Linux kernel's memory
subsystem. An unprivileged local use could exploit the flaw to cause a
denial of service (crash the system). (CVE-2012-3511)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.04:
  linux-image-2.6.38-16-generic   2.6.38-16.67
  linux-image-2.6.38-16-generic-pae  2.6.38-16.67
  linux-image-2.6.38-16-omap      2.6.38-16.67
  linux-image-2.6.38-16-powerpc   2.6.38-16.67
  linux-image-2.6.38-16-powerpc-smp  2.6.38-16.67
  linux-image-2.6.38-16-powerpc64-smp  2.6.38-16.67
  linux-image-2.6.38-16-server    2.6.38-16.67
  linux-image-2.6.38-16-versatile  2.6.38-16.67
  linux-image-2.6.38-16-virtual   2.6.38-16.67

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

select high-impact bug fixes. All announcements of official security
updates for Ubuntu releases are sent to the ubuntu-security-announce
mailing list, information about which may be found at
https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-security-announce.

Since its launch in October 2004 Ubuntu has become one of the most
highly regarded Linux distributions with millions of users in homes,
schools, businesses and governments around the world. Ubuntu is Open
Source software, costs nothing to download, and users are free to
customise or alter their software in order to meet their needs.

when applying HTTP response-splitting protection. A remote attacker could
create a specially-crafted URL and inject arbitrary headers.
(CVE-2011-1398, CVE-2012-4388)

It was discovered that PHP incorrectly handled directories with a large
number of files. This could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the web server, or to perform a denial of
service. (CVE-2012-2688)

It was discovered that PHP incorrectly parsed certain PDO prepared
statements. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause PHP to crash,
leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2012-3450)

dhcp3, isc-dhcp vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

DHCP could be made to crash if it received specially crafted network
traffic.

Software Description:
- isc-dhcp: DHCP server and client
- dhcp3: DHCP server and client

Details:

Glen Eustace discovered that the DHCP server incorrectly handled IPv6
expiration times. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause DHCP to
crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu
11.04, Ubuntu 11.10 and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. (CVE-2012-3955)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the DHCP AppArmor profile could be escaped by
using environment variables. This update mitigates the issue by sanitizing
certain variables in the DHCP shell scripts.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  isc-dhcp-client                 4.1.ESV-R4-0ubuntu5.5

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Subject: [USN-1574-1] Linux kernel (Natty backport) vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <505A357A.5060306@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1574-1
September 19, 2012

linux-lts-backport-natty vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-lts-backport-natty: Linux kernel backport from Natty

Details:

A flaw was found in how the Linux kernel passed the replacement session
keyring to a child process. An unprivileged local user could exploit this
flaw to cause a denial of service (panic). (CVE-2012-2745)

Ben Hutchings reported a flaw in the Linux kernel with some network drivers
that support TSO (TCP segment offload). A local or peer user could exploit
this flaw to to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-3412)

Jay Fenlason and Doug Ledford discovered a bug in the Linux kernel
implementation of RDS sockets. A local unprivileged user could potentially
use this flaw to read privileged information from the kernel.
(CVE-2012-3430)

A flaw was discovered in the madvise feature of the Linux kernel's memory
subsystem. An unprivileged local use could exploit the flaw to cause a
denial of service (crash the system). (CVE-2012-3511)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.38-16-generic   2.6.38-16.67~lucid1
  linux-image-2.6.38-16-generic-pae  2.6.38-16.67~lucid1
  linux-image-2.6.38-16-server    2.6.38-16.67~lucid1
  linux-image-2.6.38-16-virtual   2.6.38-16.67~lucid1

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

thunderbird regressions
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

USN-1551-1 introduced regressions in Thunderbird.

Software Description:
- thunderbird: Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

Details:

USN-1551-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Thunderbird. The new package caused a
regression in the message editor and certain performance regressions as
well. This update fixes the problems.

Original advisory details:

 Gary Kwong, Christian Holler, Jesse Ruderman, Steve Fink, Bob Clary, Andrew
 Sutherland, Jason Smith, John Schoenick, Vladimir Vukicevic and Daniel
 Holbert discovered memory safety issues affecting Thunderbird. If the user
 were tricked into opening a specially crafted E-Mail, an attacker could
 exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or
 potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking
 Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-1970, CVE-2012-1971)
 
 Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities. If the
 user were tricked into opening a specially crafted E-Mail, an attacker
 could exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or
 potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking
 Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-1972, CVE-2012-1973, CVE-2012-1974, CVE-2012-1975,
 CVE-2012-1976, CVE-2012-3956, CVE-2012-3957, CVE-2012-3958, CVE-2012-3959,
 CVE-2012-3960, CVE-2012-3961, CVE-2012-3962, CVE-2012-3963, CVE-2012-3964)
 
 Mariusz Mlynsk discovered that it is possible to shadow the location object
 using Object.defineProperty. This could potentially result in a cross-site
 scripting (XSS) attack against plugins. With cross-site scripting
 vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted
 E-Mail, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents or
 steal confidential data within the same domain. (CVE-2012-1956)
 
 Fr?d?ric Hoguin discovered that bitmap format images with a negative height
 could potentially result in memory corruption. If the user were tricked
 into opening a specially crafted image, an attacker could exploit this to
 cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute
 code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-3966)
 
 It was discovered that Thunderbird's WebGL implementation was vulnerable to
 multiple memory safety issues. If the user were tricked into opening a
 specially crafted E-Mail, an attacker could exploit these to cause a denial
 of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the
 privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-3967, CVE-2012-3968)
 
 Arthur Gerkis discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird's
 Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) implementation. If the user were tricked
 into opening a specially crafted image, an attacker could exploit these to
 cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute
 code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-3969,
 CVE-2012-3970)
 
 Christoph Diehl discovered multiple memory safety issues in the bundled
 Graphite 2 library. If the user were tricked into opening a specially
 crafted E-Mail, an attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of
 service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the
 privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-3971)
 
 Nicolas Gr?goire discovered an out-of-bounds read in the format-number
 feature of XSLT. This could potentially cause inaccurate formatting of
 numbers and information leakage. (CVE-2012-3972)
 
 It was discovered that when the DOMParser is used to parse text/html data
 in a Thunderbird extension, linked resources within this HTML data will be
 loaded. If the data being parsed in the extension is untrusted, it could
 lead to information leakage and potentially be combined with other attacks
 to become exploitable. (CVE-2012-3975)
 
 It was discovered that, in some instances, certain security checks in the
 location object could be bypassed. This could allow for the loading of
 restricted content and can potentially be combined with other issues to
 become exploitable. (CVE-2012-3978)
 
 Colby Russell discovered that eval in the web console can execute injected
 code with chrome privileges, leading to the running of malicious code in a
 privileged context. If the user were tricked into opening a specially
 crafted E-Mail, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service
 via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of
 the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-3980)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
