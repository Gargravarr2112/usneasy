xdiagnose update
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- - Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

3rd party applications using xdiagnose could potentially be made to
overwrite files.

Software Description:
- - xdiagnose: X.org diagnosis tool

in welcome.py when creating user-initiated archive files. While
failsafeX does not use the vulnerable code, this update removes this
functionality to protect any 3rd party applications which import the
vulnerable code. In the default Ubuntu installation, this should be
prevented by the Yama link restrictions.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  xdiagnose                       2.5.2ubuntu0.1

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

Software Description:
- libxslt: XSLT processing library

Details:

Chris Evans discovered that libxslt incorrectly handled generate-id XPath
functions. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a
specially crafted XSLT document, a remote attacker could obtain potentially
sensitive information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Ubuntu
10.04 LTS and Ubuntu 11.04. (CVE-2011-1202)

It was discovered that libxslt incorrectly parsed certain patterns. If a
user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted
XSLT document, a remote attacker could cause libxslt to crash, causing a
denial of service. (CVE-2011-3970)

Nicholas Gregoire discovered that libxslt incorrectly handled unexpected
DTD nodes. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a
specially crafted XSLT document, a remote attacker could cause libxslt to
crash, causing a denial of service. (CVE-2012-2825)

Nicholas Gregoire discovered that libxslt incorrectly managed memory. If a
user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted
XSLT document, a remote attacker could cause libxslt to crash, causing a
denial of service. (CVE-2012-2870)

Nicholas Gregoire discovered that libxslt incorrectly handled certain
transforms. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a
specially crafted XSLT document, a remote attacker could cause libxslt to
crash, causing a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2012-2871)

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in Python 2.6.

Software Description:
- python2.6: An interactive high-level object-oriented language

Details:

It was discovered that Python would prepend an empty string to sys.path
under certain circumstances. A local attacker with write access to the
current working directory could exploit this to execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2008-5983)

It was discovered that the audioop module did not correctly perform input
validation. If a user or automatated system were tricked into opening a
crafted audio file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via
application crash. (CVE-2010-1634, CVE-2010-2089)

Giampaolo Rodola discovered several race conditions in the smtpd module.
A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via
daemon outage. (CVE-2010-3493)

It was discovered that the CGIHTTPServer module did properly perform
input validation on certain HTTP GET requests. A remote attacker could
potentially obtain access to CGI script source files. (CVE-2011-1015)

Niels Heinen discovered that the urllib and urllib2 modules would process
Location headers that specify a redirection to file: URLs. A remote
attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information or cause a
denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04. (CVE-2011-1521)

It was discovered that SimpleHTTPServer did not use a charset parameter in
the Content-Type HTTP header. An attacker could potentially exploit this
to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against Internet Explorer 7
users. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04. (CVE-2011-4940)

It was discovered that Python distutils contained a race condition when
creating the ~/.pypirc file. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain
sensitive information. (CVE-2011-4944)

Subject: [USN-1597-1] Linux kernel (EC2) vulnerability
Message-ID: <506E5D5B.2090008@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1597-1
October 05, 2012

linux-ec2 vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

The system could be made to crash under certain conditions.

Software Description:
- linux-ec2: Linux kernel for EC2

Details:

A flaw was found in how the Linux kernel passed the replacement session
keyring to a child process. An unprivileged local user could exploit this
flaw to cause a denial of service (panic).

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-349-ec2      2.6.32-349.55

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

moin vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in MoinMoin.

Software Description:
- moin: Collaborative hypertext environment

Details:

It was discovered that MoinMoin did not properly sanitize certain input,
resulting in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. With cross-site
scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing server
output during a crafted server request, a remote attacker could exploit
this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same
domain. (CVE-2011-1058)

It was discovered that MoinMoin incorrectly handled group names that
contain virtual group names such as "All", "Known" or "Trusted". This could
result in a remote user having incorrect permissions. (CVE-2012-4404)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  python-moinmoin                 1.9.3-1ubuntu2.1

Ubuntu 11.10:
  python-moinmoin                 1.9.3-1ubuntu1.11.10.1

Ubuntu 11.04:
  python-moinmoin                 1.9.3-1ubuntu1.11.04.1

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  python-moinmoin                 1.9.2-2ubuntu3.2

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

Message-ID: <507717A6.80004@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1606-1
October 11, 2012

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

A flaw was found in how the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel-based Virtual
Machine) subsystem handled MSI (Message Signaled Interrupts). A local
unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service or
potentially elevate privileges. (CVE-2012-2137)

A flaw was found in how the Linux kernel passed the replacement session
keyring to a child process. An unprivileged local user could exploit this
flaw to cause a denial of service (panic). (CVE-2012-2745)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-44-386       2.6.32-44.98
  linux-image-2.6.32-44-generic   2.6.32-44.98
  linux-image-2.6.32-44-generic-pae  2.6.32-44.98
  linux-image-2.6.32-44-ia64      2.6.32-44.98
  linux-image-2.6.32-44-lpia      2.6.32-44.98
  linux-image-2.6.32-44-powerpc   2.6.32-44.98
  linux-image-2.6.32-44-powerpc-smp  2.6.32-44.98
  linux-image-2.6.32-44-powerpc64-smp  2.6.32-44.98
  linux-image-2.6.32-44-preempt   2.6.32-44.98
  linux-image-2.6.32-44-server    2.6.32-44.98
  linux-image-2.6.32-44-sparc64   2.6.32-44.98
  linux-image-2.6.32-44-sparc64-smp  2.6.32-44.98
  linux-image-2.6.32-44-versatile  2.6.32-44.98
  linux-image-2.6.32-44-virtual   2.6.32-44.98

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird.

Software Description:
- thunderbird: Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

Details:

Henrik Skupin, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Soroush Dalili and others
discovered several memory corruption flaws in Thunderbird. If a user were
tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, an
attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within
the context of another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the
program. (CVE-2012-3982, CVE-2012-3983, CVE-2012-3988, CVE-2012-3989,
CVE-2012-4191)

David Bloom and Jordi Chancel discovered that Thunderbird did not always
properly handle the <select> element. If a user were tricked into opening a
malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could
exploit this to conduct URL spoofing and clickjacking attacks.
(CVE-2012-3984)

Collin Jackson discovered that Thunderbird did not properly follow the
HTML5 specification for document.domain behavior. If a user were tricked
into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a remote
attacker could exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
via JavaScript execution. (CVE-2012-3985)

Johnny Stenback discovered that Thunderbird did not properly perform
security checks on test methods for DOMWindowUtils. (CVE-2012-3986)

Alice White discovered that the security checks for GetProperty could be
bypassed when using JSAPI. If a user were tricked into opening a specially
crafted web page and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could
exploit this to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.
(CVE-2012-3991)

Mariusz Mlynski discovered a history state error in Thunderbird. If a user
were tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a
remote attacker could exploit this to spoof the location property to inject
script or intercept posted data. (CVE-2012-3992)

Mariusz Mlynski and others discovered several flaws in Thunderbird that
allowed a remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into
viewing a specially crafted page and had JavaScript enabled, a remote
attacker could exploit these to modify the contents, or steal confidential
data, within the same domain. (CVE-2012-3993, CVE-2012-3994, CVE-2012-4184)

Abhishek Arya, Atte Kettunen and others discovered several memory flaws in
Thunderbird when using the Address Sanitizer tool. If a user were tricked
into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, an attacker
could exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context
of another website or execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the
program. (CVE-2012-3990, CVE-2012-3995, CVE-2012-4179, CVE-2012-4180,
CVE-2012-4181, CVE-2012-4182, CVE-2012-4183, CVE-2012-4185, CVE-2012-4186,
CVE-2012-4187, CVE-2012-4188)

It was discovered that Thunderbird allowed improper access to the Location
object. An attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information.
Under certain circumstances, a remote attacker could use this vulnerability
to potentially execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.
(CVE-2012-4192, CVE-2012-4193)

under certain circumstances. A local attacker with write access to the
current working directory could exploit this to execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2008-5983)

It was discovered that the audioop module did not correctly perform input
validation. If a user or automatated system were tricked into opening a
crafted audio file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via
application crash. (CVE-2010-1634, CVE-2010-2089)

Giampaolo Rodola discovered several race conditions in the smtpd module.
A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via
daemon outage. (CVE-2010-3493)

It was discovered that the CGIHTTPServer module did not properly perform
input validation on certain HTTP GET requests. A remote attacker could
potentially obtain access to CGI script source files. (CVE-2011-1015)

Niels Heinen discovered that the urllib and urllib2 modules would process
Location headers that specify a redirection to file: URLs. A remote
attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information or cause a
denial of service. (CVE-2011-1521)

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1616-1
October 24, 2012

python3.1 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in Python 3.1.

Software Description:
- python3.1: An interactive high-level object-oriented language (version
3.1)

Details:

It was discovered that Python would prepend an empty string to sys.path
under certain circumstances. A local attacker with write access to the
current working directory could exploit this to execute arbitrary code.
This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. (CVE-2008-5983)

It was discovered that the audioop module did not correctly perform input
validation. If a user or automatated system were tricked into opening a
crafted audio file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via
application crash. These issues only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.
(CVE-2010-1634, CVE-2010-2089)

It was discovered that Python distutils contained a race condition when
creating the ~/.pypirc file. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain
sensitive information. (CVE-2011-4944)

It was discovered that SimpleXMLRPCServer did not properly validate its
input when handling HTTP POST requests. A remote attacker could exploit
this to cause a denial of service via excessive CPU utilization.
(CVE-2012-0845)

It was discovered that Python was susceptible to hash algorithm attacks.
An attacker could cause a denial of service under certian circumstances.
This update adds the '-R' command line option and honors setting the
PYTHONHASHSEED environment variable to 'random' to salt str and datetime
objects with an unpredictable value. (CVE-2012-1150)

Serhiy Storchaka discovered that the UTF16 decoder in Python did not
properly reset internal variables after error handling. An attacker could
exploit this to cause a denial of service via memory corruption.
(CVE-2012-2135)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.04:
  python3.1                       3.1.3-1ubuntu1.2
  python3.1-minimal               3.1.3-1ubuntu1.2

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  python3.1                       3.1.2-0ubuntu3.2
  python3.1-minimal               3.1.2-0ubuntu3.2

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

Subject: Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal) end-of-life reached on October 28, 2012
Message-ID: <1351441488.14862.106.camel@veni>

This note is just to confirm that the support period for Ubuntu 11.04
(Natty Narwhal) formally ends on October 28, 2012 and Ubuntu Security
Notices no longer includes information or updated packages for 
Ubuntu 11.04.  

The supported upgrade path from Ubuntu 11.04 is via Ubuntu 11.10

found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OneiricUpgrades.  Note 
that upgrades to version 11.10 and beyond are only supported in

Both Ubuntu 11.10 and Ubuntu 12.04 continue to be actively

All announcements of official security updates for Ubuntu releases 
are sent to the ubuntu-security-announce mailing list, information

Since its launch in October 2004 Ubuntu has become one of the most
highly regarded Linux distributions with millions of users in homes,
schools, businesses and governments around the world. Ubuntu is Open
Source software, costs nothing to download, and users are free to
customize or alter their software in order to meet their needs.

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1620-2
October 30, 2012

thunderbird vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.10
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird.

Software Description:
- thunderbird: Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

Details:

USN-1620-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. This update provides the
corresponding updates for Thunderbird. Please note that Thunderbird is only
affected by window.location issues through RSS feeds and extensions that
load web content.

Original advisory details:

 Mariusz Mlynski and others discovered several flaws in Firefox that allowed
 a remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
 (CVE-2012-4194, CVE-2012-4195)
 
 Antoine Delignat-Lavaud discovered a flaw in the way Firefox handled the
 Location object. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted
 page, a remote attacker could exploit this to bypass security protections
 and perform cross-origin reading of the Location object. (CVE-2012-4196)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.10:
  thunderbird                     16.0.2+build1-0ubuntu0.12.10.1

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  thunderbird                     16.0.2+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1

Ubuntu 11.10:
  thunderbird                     16.0.2+build1-0ubuntu0.11.10.1

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  thunderbird                     16.0.2+build1-0ubuntu0.10.04.1

After a standard system update you need to restart Thunderbird to make all
the necessary changes.
