 Joe Drew, Wayne Mery, Alon Zakai, Christian Holler, Gary Kwong, Luke
 Wagner, Terrence Cole, Timothy Nikkel, Bill McCloskey, and Nicolas Pierron
 discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user
 were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could
 possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash.
 (CVE-2013-0783, CVE-2013-0784)

 Atte Kettunen discovered that Firefox could perform an out-of-bounds read
 while rendering GIF format images. An attacker could exploit this to crash
 Firefox. (CVE-2013-0772)

 Boris Zbarsky discovered that Firefox did not properly handle some wrapped
 WebIDL objects. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted
 page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to cause a denial of service
 via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of
 the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-0765)

 Bobby Holley discovered vulnerabilities in Chrome Object Wrappers (COW) and
 System Only Wrappers (SOW). If a user were tricked into opening a specially
 crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to bypass security
 protections to obtain sensitive information or potentially execute code
 with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-0773)

 Frederik Braun discovered that Firefox made the location of the active
 browser profile available to JavaScript workers. (CVE-2013-0774)

Subject: [USN-1756-1] Linux kernel vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <51371751.8030708@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1756-1
March 06, 2013

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

A failure to validate input was discovered in the Linux kernel's Xen
netback (network backend) driver. A user in a guest OS may exploit this
flaw to cause a denial of service to the guest OS and other guest domains.
(CVE-2013-0216)

A memory leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's Xen netback (network
backend) driver. A user in a guest OS could trigger this flaw to cause a
denial of service on the system. (CVE-2013-0217)

Andrew Jones discovered a flaw with the xen_iret function in Linux kernel's
Xen virtualizeation. In the 32-bit Xen paravirt platform an unprivileged
guest OS user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash
the system) or gain guest OS privilege. (CVE-2013-0228)

A flaw was reported in the permission checks done by the Linux kernel for
/dev/cpu/*/msr. A local root user with all capabilities dropped could
exploit this flaw to execute code with full root capabilities.
(CVE-2013-0268)

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's vhost driver used to accelerate
guest networking in KVM based virtual machines. A privileged guest user
could exploit this flaw to crash the host system. (CVE-2013-0311)

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth stack
when HIDP (Human Interface Device Protocol) support is enabled. A local
unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause an information leak from
the kernel. (CVE-2013-0349)

A flaw was discovered on the Linux kernel's VFAT filesystem driver when a
disk is mounted with the utf8 option (this is the default on Ubuntu). On a
system where disks/images can be auto-mounted or a FAT filesystem is
mounted an unprivileged user can exploit the flaw to gain root privileges.
(CVE-2013-1773)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  linux-image-3.0.0-32-generic    3.0.0-32.50
  linux-image-3.0.0-32-generic-pae  3.0.0-32.50
  linux-image-3.0.0-32-omap       3.0.0-32.50
  linux-image-3.0.0-32-powerpc    3.0.0-32.50
  linux-image-3.0.0-32-powerpc-smp  3.0.0-32.50
  linux-image-3.0.0-32-powerpc64-smp  3.0.0-32.50
  linux-image-3.0.0-32-server     3.0.0-32.50
  linux-image-3.0.0-32-virtual    3.0.0-32.50

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

python-django vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.10
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in Django.

Software Description:
- python-django: High-level Python web development framework

Details:

James Kettle discovered that Django did not properly filter the Host HTTP
header when processing certain requests. An attacker could exploit this to
generate and display arbitrary URLs to users. Although this issue had been
previously addressed in USN-1632-1, this update adds additional hardening
measures to host header validation. This update also adds a new
ALLOWED_HOSTS setting that can be set to a list of acceptable values for
headers. (CVE-2012-4520)

Orange Tsai discovered that Django incorrectly performed permission checks
when displaying the history view in the admin interface. An administrator
could use this flaw to view the history of any object, regardless of
intended permissions. (CVE-2013-0305)

It was discovered that Django incorrectly handled a large number of forms
when generating formsets. An attacker could use this flaw to cause Django
to consume memory, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2013-0306)

It was discovered that Django incorrectly deserialized XML. An attacker
could use this flaw to perform entity-expansion and external-entity/DTD
attacks. This updated modified Django behaviour to no longer allow DTDs,
perform entity expansion, or fetch external entities/DTDs. (CVE-2013-1664,
CVE-2013-1665)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.10:
  python-django                   1.4.1-2ubuntu0.3

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  python-django                   1.3.1-4ubuntu1.6

Ubuntu 11.10:
  python-django                   1.3-2ubuntu1.6

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  python-django                   1.1.1-2ubuntu1.8

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

Subject: [USN-1760-1] Linux kernel (Oneiric backport) vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <513F9889.7030202@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1760-1
March 12, 2013

linux-lts-backport-oneiric vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-lts-backport-oneiric: Linux kernel backport from Oneiric

Details:

A failure to validate input was discovered in the Linux kernel's Xen
netback (network backend) driver. A user in a guest OS may exploit this
flaw to cause a denial of service to the guest OS and other guest domains.
(CVE-2013-0216)

A memory leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's Xen netback (network
backend) driver. A user in a guest OS could trigger this flaw to cause a
denial of service on the system. (CVE-2013-0217)

Andrew Jones discovered a flaw with the xen_iret function in Linux kernel's
Xen virtualizeation. In the 32-bit Xen paravirt platform an unprivileged
guest OS user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash
the system) or gain guest OS privilege. (CVE-2013-0228)

A flaw was reported in the permission checks done by the Linux kernel for
/dev/cpu/*/msr. A local root user with all capabilities dropped could
exploit this flaw to execute code with full root capabilities.
(CVE-2013-0268)

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's vhost driver used to accelerate
guest networking in KVM based virtual machines. A privileged guest user
could exploit this flaw to crash the host system. (CVE-2013-0311)

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth stack
when HIDP (Human Interface Device Protocol) support is enabled. A local
unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause an information leak from
the kernel. (CVE-2013-0349)

A flaw was discovered on the Linux kernel's VFAT filesystem driver when a
disk is mounted with the utf8 option (this is the default on Ubuntu). On a
system where disks/images can be auto-mounted or a FAT filesystem is
mounted an unprivileged user can exploit the flaw to gain root privileges.
(CVE-2013-1773)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.0.0-32-generic    3.0.0-32.50~lucid1
  linux-image-3.0.0-32-generic-pae  3.0.0-32.50~lucid1
  linux-image-3.0.0-32-server     3.0.0-32.50~lucid1
  linux-image-3.0.0-32-virtual    3.0.0-32.50~lucid1

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

apt vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.10
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 11.10

Summary:

An attacker could trick APT into installing altered packages.

Software Description:
- apt: Advanced front-end for dpkg

Details:

Ansgar Burchardt discovered that APT incorrectly handled repositories that
use InRelease files. The default Ubuntu repositories do not use InRelease
files, so this issue only affected third-party repositories. If a remote
attacker were able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could
potentially be used to install altered packages.

This update corrects the issue by disabling InRelease file support
completely.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.10:
  apt                             0.9.7.5ubuntu5.4

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  apt                             0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.10

Ubuntu 11.10:
  apt                             0.8.16~exp5ubuntu13.7

apache2 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.10
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the Apache HTTP Server.

Software Description:
- apache2: Apache HTTP server

Details:

Niels Heinen discovered that multiple modules incorrectly sanitized certain
strings, which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site
scripting attacks when processing the output. With cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing server output during a
crafted server request, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the
contents, or steal confidential data (such as passwords), within the same
domain. (CVE-2012-3499, CVE-2012-4558)

It was discovered that the mod_proxy_ajp module incorrectly handled error
states. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the server to stop
responding, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only applied to
Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and Ubuntu 11.10. (CVE-2012-4557)

It was discovered that the apache2ctl script shipped in Ubuntu packages
incorrectly created the lock directory. A local attacker could possibly use
this issue to gain privileges. The symlink protections in Ubuntu 11.10 and
later should reduce this vulnerability to a denial of service.
(CVE-2013-1048)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.10:
  apache2.2-common                2.2.22-6ubuntu2.2

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  apache2.2-common                2.2.22-1ubuntu1.3

Ubuntu 11.10:
  apache2.2-common                2.2.20-1ubuntu1.4

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1767-1
March 18, 2013

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Andrew Cooper of Citrix reported a Xen stack corruption in the Linux
kernel. An unprivileged user in a 32bit PVOPS guest can cause the guest
kernel to crash, or operate erroneously. (CVE-2013-0190)

A failure to validate input was discovered in the Linux kernel's Xen
netback (network backend) driver. A user in a guest OS may exploit this
flaw to cause a denial of service to the guest OS and other guest domains.
(CVE-2013-0216)

A memory leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's Xen netback (network
backend) driver. A user in a guest OS could trigger this flaw to cause a
denial of service on the system. (CVE-2013-0217)

Andrew Jones discovered a flaw with the xen_iret function in Linux kernel's
Xen virtualizeation. In the 32-bit Xen paravirt platform an unprivileged
guest OS user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash
the system) or gain guest OS privilege. (CVE-2013-0228)

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel Xen PCI backend driver. If a PCI
device is assigned to the guest OS, the guest OS could exploit this flaw to
cause a denial of service on the host. (CVE-2013-0231)

A flaw was reported in the permission checks done by the Linux kernel for
/dev/cpu/*/msr. A local root user with all capabilities dropped could
exploit this flaw to execute code with full root capabilities.
(CVE-2013-0268)

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's vhost driver used to accelerate
guest networking in KVM based virtual machines. A privileged guest user
could exploit this flaw to crash the host system. (CVE-2013-0311)

A flaw was discovered in the Extended Verification Module (EVM) of the
Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user code exploit this flaw to cause a
denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2013-0313)

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth stack
when HIDP (Human Interface Device Protocol) support is enabled. A local
unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause an information leak from
the kernel. (CVE-2013-0349)

A flaw was discovered in the Edgeort USB serial converter driver when the
device is disconnected while it is in use. A local user could exploit this
flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2013-1774)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.2.0-39-generic    3.2.0-39.62
  linux-image-3.2.0-39-generic-pae  3.2.0-39.62
  linux-image-3.2.0-39-highbank   3.2.0-39.62
  linux-image-3.2.0-39-omap       3.2.0-39.62
  linux-image-3.2.0-39-powerpc-smp  3.2.0-39.62
  linux-image-3.2.0-39-powerpc64-smp  3.2.0-39.62
  linux-image-3.2.0-39-virtual    3.2.0-39.62

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Details:

Loganathan Parthipan discovered that Nova did not properly validate VNC
tokens after an instance was deleted. An authenticated attacker could
exploit this to access other virtual machines under certain circumstances.
This issue did not affect Ubuntu 11.10. (CVE-2013-0335)

Vish Ishaya discovered that Nova did not always enforce quotas on fixed
IPs. An authenticated attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of
service via resource consumption. Nova will now enforce a quota limit of
10 fixed IPs per instance, which is configurable via 'quota_fixed_ips'
in /etc/nova/nova.conf. (CVE-2013-1838)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.10:

Details:

Guang Yee discovered that Keystone would not always perform all
verification checks when configured to use PKI. If the keystone server was
configured to use PKI and services or users requested online verification,
an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass revocation checks.
Keystone uses UUID tokens by default in Ubuntu.

Message-ID: <514B07D1.3050007@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1774-1
March 21, 2013

linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.10

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-ti-omap4: Linux kernel for OMAP4

Details:

Andrew Cooper of Citrix reported a Xen stack corruption in the Linux
kernel. An unprivileged user in a 32bit PVOPS guest can cause the guest
kernel to crash, or operate erroneously. (CVE-2013-0190)

A failure to validate input was discovered in the Linux kernel's Xen
netback (network backend) driver. A user in a guest OS may exploit this
flaw to cause a denial of service to the guest OS and other guest domains.
(CVE-2013-0216)

A memory leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's Xen netback (network
backend) driver. A user in a guest OS could trigger this flaw to cause a
denial of service on the system. (CVE-2013-0217)

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel Xen PCI backend driver. If a PCI
device is assigned to the guest OS, the guest OS could exploit this flaw to
cause a denial of service on the host. (CVE-2013-0231)

Tommi Rantala discovered a flaw in the a flaw the Linux kernels handling of
datagrams packets when the MSG_PEEK flag is specified. An unprivileged
local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system
hang). (CVE-2013-0290)

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's vhost driver used to accelerate
guest networking in KVM based virtual machines. A privileged guest user
could exploit this flaw to crash the host system. (CVE-2013-0311)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.10:
  linux-image-3.5.0-221-omap4     3.5.0-221.31

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in OpenSSL.

Software Description:
- openssl: Secure Socket Layer (SSL) cryptographic library and tools

Details:

USN-1732-1 fixed vulnerabilities in OpenSSL. The fix for CVE-2013-0169 and
CVE-2012-2686 was reverted in USN-1732-2 because of a regression. This
update restores the security fix, and includes an extra fix from upstream
to address the AES-NI regression. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Adam Langley and Wolfgang Ettlingers discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly
 handled certain crafted CBC data when used with AES-NI. A remote attacker
 could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of
 service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 12.10.
 (CVE-2012-2686)
  Nadhem Alfardan and Kenny Paterson discovered that the TLS protocol as
used
 in OpenSSL was vulnerable to a timing side-channel attack known as the
 "Lucky Thirteen" issue. A remote attacker could use this issue to perform
 plaintext-recovery attacks via analysis of timing data. (CVE-2013-0169)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.10:
  libssl1.0.0                     1.0.1c-3ubuntu2.3

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  libssl1.0.0                     1.0.1-4ubuntu5.8

Subject: [USN-1781-1] Linux kernel (OMAP4) vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <5151B60E.4040106@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1781-1
March 26, 2013

linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-ti-omap4: Linux kernel for OMAP4

Details:

Andrew Jones discovered a flaw with the xen_iret function in Linux kernel's
Xen virtualizeation. In the 32-bit Xen paravirt platform an unprivileged
guest OS user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash
the system) or gain guest OS privilege. (CVE-2013-0228)

A flaw was reported in the permission checks done by the Linux kernel for
/dev/cpu/*/msr. A local root user with all capabilities dropped could
exploit this flaw to execute code with full root capabilities.
(CVE-2013-0268)

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's vhost driver used to accelerate
guest networking in KVM based virtual machines. A privileged guest user
could exploit this flaw to crash the host system. (CVE-2013-0311)

A flaw was discovered in the Extended Verification Module (EVM) of the
Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user code exploit this flaw to cause a
denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2013-0313)

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth stack
when HIDP (Human Interface Device Protocol) support is enabled. A local
unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause an information leak from
the kernel. (CVE-2013-0349)

A flaw was discovered in the Edgeort USB serial converter driver when the
device is disconnected while it is in use. A local user could exploit this
flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2013-1774)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.2.0-1427-omap4    3.2.0-1427.36

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Subject: [USN-1783-1] Bind vulnerability
Message-ID: <51559108.8040101@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1783-1
March 29, 2013

bind9 vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.10
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Bind could be made to consume memory or crash if it received specially
crafted network traffic.

Software Description:
- bind9: Internet Domain Name Server

Details:

Matthew Horsfall discovered that Bind incorrectly handled regular
expression checking. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause Bind to
consume an excessive amount of memory, possibly resulting in a denial of
service. This issue was corrected by disabling RDATA regular expression
syntax checking.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.10:
  bind9                           1:9.8.1.dfsg.P1-4.2ubuntu3.2
  libdns81                        1:9.8.1.dfsg.P1-4.2ubuntu3.2

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  bind9                           1:9.8.1.dfsg.P1-4ubuntu0.6
  libdns81                        1:9.8.1.dfsg.P1-4ubuntu0.6

Ubuntu 11.10:
  bind9                           1:9.7.3.dfsg-1ubuntu4.6
  libdns69                        1:9.7.3.dfsg-1ubuntu4.6

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  bind9                           1:9.7.0.dfsg.P1-1ubuntu0.9
  libdns64                        1:9.7.0.dfsg.P1-1ubuntu0.9

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
