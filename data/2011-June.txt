linux, linux-ec2 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Multiple kernel vulnerabilities have been fixed.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel
- linux-ec2: Linux kernel for EC2

Details:

Brad Spengler discovered that the kernel did not correctly account for
userspace memory allocations during exec() calls. A local attacker could
exploit this to consume all system memory, leading to a denial of service.
(CVE-2010-4243)

Alexander Duyck discovered that the Intel Gigabit Ethernet driver did not
correctly handle certain configurations. If such a device was configured
without VLANs, a remote attacker could crash the system, leading to a
denial of service. (CVE-2010-4263)

Nelson Elhage discovered that Econet did not correctly handle AUN packets
over UDP. A local attacker could send specially crafted traffic to crash
the system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4342)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that IRDA did not correctly check the size of
buffers. On non-x86 systems, a local attacker could exploit this to read
kernel heap memory, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2010-4529)

Dan Rosenburg discovered that the CAN subsystem leaked kernel addresses
into the /proc filesystem. A local attacker could use this to increase
the chances of a successful memory corruption exploit. (CVE-2010-4565)

Kees Cook discovered that the IOWarrior USB device driver did not
correctly check certain size fields. A local attacker with physical
access could plug in a specially crafted USB device to crash the system
or potentially gain root privileges. (CVE-2010-4656)

Goldwyn Rodrigues discovered that the OCFS2 filesystem did not correctly
clear memory when writing certain file holes. A local attacker could
exploit this to read uninitialized data from the disk, leading to a loss
of privacy. (CVE-2011-0463)

Dan Carpenter discovered that the TTPCI DVB driver did not check certain
values during an ioctl. If the dvb-ttpci module was loaded, a local
attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of
service, or possibly gain root privileges. (CVE-2011-0521)

Jens Kuehnel discovered that the InfiniBand driver contained a race
condition. On systems using InfiniBand, a local attacker could send
specially crafted requests to crash the system, leading to a denial of
service. (CVE-2011-0695)

Rafael Dominguez Vega discovered that the caiaq Native Instruments USB
driver did not correctly validate string lengths. A local attacker with
physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB device to crash
the system or potentially gain root privileges. (CVE-2011-0712)

Kees Cook reported that /proc/pid/stat did not correctly filter certain
memory locations. A local attacker could determine the memory layout of
processes in an attempt to increase the chances of a successful memory
corruption exploit. (CVE-2011-0726)

Timo Warns discovered that MAC partition parsing routines did not
correctly calculate block counts. A local attacker with physical access
could plug in a specially crafted block device to crash the system or
potentially gain root privileges. (CVE-2011-1010)

Timo Warns discovered that LDM partition parsing routines did not
correctly calculate block counts. A local attacker with physical access
could plug in a specially crafted block device to crash the system, leading
to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-1012)

Matthiew Herrb discovered that the drm modeset interface did not correctly
handle a signed comparison. A local attacker could exploit this to crash
the system or possibly gain root privileges. (CVE-2011-1013)

Marek Ol??k discovered that the Radeon GPU drivers did not correctly
validate certain registers. On systems with specific hardware,
a local attacker could exploit this to write to arbitrary video
memory. (CVE-2011-1016)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the CAP_SYS_MODULE capability was not
needed to load kernel modules. A local attacker with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
capability could load existing kernel modules, possibly increasing the
attack surface available on the system. (CVE-2011-1019)

Nelson Elhage discovered that the epoll subsystem did not correctly handle
certain structures. A local attacker could create malicious requests that
would hang the system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-1082)

Nelson Elhage discovered that the epoll subsystem did not correctly handle
certain structures. A local attacker could create malicious requests that
would consume large amounts of CPU, leading to a denial of service.
(CVE-2011-1083)

Julien Tinnes discovered that the kernel did not correctly validate
the signal structure from tkill(). A local attacker could exploit
this to send signals to arbitrary threads, possibly bypassing expected
restrictions. (CVE-2011-1182)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-316-ec2      2.6.32-316.31
  linux-image-2.6.32-32-386       2.6.32-32.62
  linux-image-2.6.32-32-generic   2.6.32-32.62
  linux-image-2.6.32-32-generic-pae  2.6.32-32.62
  linux-image-2.6.32-32-ia64      2.6.32-32.62
  linux-image-2.6.32-32-lpia      2.6.32-32.62
  linux-image-2.6.32-32-powerpc   2.6.32-32.62
  linux-image-2.6.32-32-powerpc-smp  2.6.32-32.62
  linux-image-2.6.32-32-powerpc64-smp  2.6.32-32.62
  linux-image-2.6.32-32-preempt   2.6.32-32.62
  linux-image-2.6.32-32-server    2.6.32-32.62
  linux-image-2.6.32-32-sparc64   2.6.32-32.62
  linux-image-2.6.32-32-sparc64-smp  2.6.32-32.62
  linux-image-2.6.32-32-versatile  2.6.32-32.62
  linux-image-2.6.32-32-virtual   2.6.32-32.62

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Message-ID: <20110601201203.GC14497@alcor.net>

"Time brings all things to pass." - Aeschylus 

Ubuntu announced its 6.06 Server release 5 years ago, on June 1,
2006.  For the LTS Server releases, Ubuntu committed to ongoing
security and critical fixes for a period of 5 years. The maintenance
period has now ended for Ubuntu 6.06 LTS Server.  

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS was a major milestone for the Ubuntu project, being the
first long-term release.  Its retirement evokes memories of Ubuntu as a
younger project, and reminds us of all that we've accomplished together in
the five years since we released the "Dapper Drake".

Thanks to everyone who helped make it happen!

Subject: [USN-1145-1] QEMU vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <1307710972.9469.0.camel@localhost>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1145-1
June 09, 2011

qemu-kvm vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

A privileged attacker within a QEMU guest could cause QEMU to crash.

Software Description:
- qemu-kvm: Machine emulator and virtualizer

Details:

It was discovered that QEMU did not properly perform validation of I/O
operations from the guest which could lead to heap corruption. An attacker
could exploit this to cause a denial of service of the guest or possibly
execute code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.
(CVE-2011-1750)

Nelson Elhage discoverd that QEMU did not properly handle memory when
removing ISA devices. An attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of
service of the guest or possibly execute code with the privileges of the
user invoking the program. (CVE-2011-1751)

When using QEMU with libvirt or virtualization management software based on
libvirt such as Eucalyptus and OpenStack, QEMU guests are individually isolated
by an AppArmor profile by default in Ubuntu.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.04:
  qemu-kvm                        0.14.0+noroms-0ubuntu4.1

Ubuntu 10.10:
  qemu-kvm                        0.12.5+noroms-0ubuntu7.5
  qemu-kvm-extras                 0.12.5+noroms-0ubuntu7.5
  qemu-kvm-extras-static          0.12.5+noroms-0ubuntu7.5

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  qemu-kvm                        0.12.3+noroms-0ubuntu9.9
  qemu-kvm-extras                 0.12.3+noroms-0ubuntu9.9
  qemu-kvm-extras-static          0.12.3+noroms-0ubuntu9.9

After a standard system update you need to restart running virtual machines
to make all the necessary changes.

Summary:

An attacker could send crafted input to tgt and cause it to crash or run
arbitrary programs.

Software Description:
- tgt: Linux SCSI target user-space tools

Details:

It was discovered that tgt incorrectly handled long iSCSI name strings, and
invalid PDUs. A remote attacker could exploit this to cause tgt to crash,
resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This
issue only affected Ubuntu 10.10. (CVE-2010-2221)

Emmanuel Bouillon discovered that tgt incorrectly handled certain iSCSI
logins. A remote attacker could exploit this to cause tgt to crash,
resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2011-0001)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.04:
  tgt                             1:1.0.13-0ubuntu2.1

Ubuntu 10.10:
  tgt                             1:1.0.4-1ubuntu4.1

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

firefox regression
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.04

Summary:

Under certain circumstances, the updated translations could unintentionally
install firefox.

Software Description:
- firefox: Safe and easy web browser from Mozilla

Details:

USN-1157-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. Unfortunately, this update
produced the side effect of pulling in Firefox on some systems that did not
have it installed during a dist-upgrade due to changes in the Ubuntu
language packs. This update fixes the problem. We apologize for the
inconvenience.

Subject: [USN-1158-1] curl vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <20110624033150.GB3479@nxnw.org>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1158-1
June 24, 2011

curl vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

Summary:

Multiple vulnerabilities in curl.

Software Description:
- curl: HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP client and client libraries

Details:

Richard Silverman discovered that when doing GSSAPI authentication,
libcurl unconditionally performs credential delegation, handing the
server a copy of the client's security credential. (CVE-2011-2192)

Wesley Miaw discovered that when zlib is enabled, libcurl does not
properly restrict the amount of callback data sent to an application
that requests automatic decompression. This might allow an attacker to
cause a denial of service via an application crash or possibly execute
arbitrary code with the privilege of the application. This issue only
affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS and Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. (CVE-2010-0734)

USN 818-1 fixed an issue with curl's handling of SSL certificates with
zero bytes in the Common Name. Due to a packaging error, the fix for
this issue was not being applied during the build. This issue only
affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. We apologize for the error. (CVE-2009-2417)

Original advisory details:

 Scott Cantor discovered that curl did not correctly handle SSL
 certificates with zero bytes in the Common Name. A remote attacker
 could exploit this to perform a man in the middle attack to view
 sensitive information or alter encrypted communications.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.04:
  libcurl3                        7.21.3-1ubuntu1.2
  libcurl3-gnutls                 7.21.3-1ubuntu1.2
  libcurl3-nss                    7.21.3-1ubuntu1.2

Ubuntu 10.10:
  libcurl3                        7.21.0-1ubuntu1.1
  libcurl3-gnutls                 7.21.0-1ubuntu1.1

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  libcurl3                        7.19.7-1ubuntu1.1
  libcurl3-gnutls                 7.19.7-1ubuntu1.1

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS:
  libcurl3                        7.18.0-1ubuntu2.3
  libcurl3-gnutls                 7.18.0-1ubuntu2.3

After a standard system update you need to restart any applications
that make use of libcurl to make all the necessary changes.

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.10

Summary:

Multiple kernel vulnerabilities have been fixed.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Dan Rosenberg discovered that IRDA did not correctly check the size of
buffers. On non-x86 systems, a local attacker could exploit this to read
kernel heap memory, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2010-4529)

Dan Rosenburg discovered that the CAN subsystem leaked kernel addresses
into the /proc filesystem. A local attacker could use this to increase the
chances of a successful memory corruption exploit. (CVE-2010-4565)

Kees Cook discovered that the IOWarrior USB device driver did not correctly
check certain size fields. A local attacker with physical access could plug
in a specially crafted USB device to crash the system or potentially gain
root privileges. (CVE-2010-4656)

handle a signed comparison. A local attacker could exploit this to crash
the system or possibly gain root privileges. (CVE-2011-1013)

Marek Ol??k discovered that the Radeon GPU drivers did not correctly
validate certain registers. On systems with specific hardware, a local
attacker could exploit this to write to arbitrary video memory.
(CVE-2011-1016)

Timo Warns discovered that the LDM disk partition handling code did not
correctly handle certain values. By inserting a specially crafted disk
device, a local attacker could exploit this to gain root privileges.
(CVE-2011-1017)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the CAP_SYS_MODULE capability was not
needed to load kernel modules. A local attacker with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
capability could load existing kernel modules, possibly increasing the
attack surface available on the system. (CVE-2011-1019)

Nelson Elhage discovered that the epoll subsystem did not correctly handle
certain structures. A local attacker could create malicious requests that
would hang the system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-1082)

Nelson Elhage discovered that the epoll subsystem did not correctly handle
certain structures. A local attacker could create malicious requests that
would consume large amounts of CPU, leading to a denial of service.
(CVE-2011-1083)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that some ALSA drivers did not correctly check the
adapter index during ioctl calls. If this driver was loaded, a local
attacker could make a specially crafted ioctl call to gain root privileges.
(CVE-2011-1169)

Julien Tinnes discovered that the kernel did not correctly validate the
signal structure from tkill(). A local attacker could exploit this to send
signals to arbitrary threads, possibly bypassing expected restrictions.
(CVE-2011-1182)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that MPT devices did not correctly validate
certain values in ioctl calls. If these drivers were loaded, a local
attacker could exploit this to read arbitrary kernel memory, leading to a
loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-1494, CVE-2011-1495)

Tavis Ormandy discovered that the pidmap function did not correctly handle
large requests. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system,
leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-1593)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the AGP driver did not check certain ioctl
values. A local attacker with access to the video subsystem could exploit
this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service, or possibly gain
root privileges. (CVE-2011-1745, CVE-2011-2022)

Oliver Hartkopp and Dave Jones discovered that the CAN network driver did
not correctly validate certain socket structures. If this driver was
loaded, a local attacker could crash the system, leading to a denial of
service. (CVE-2011-1748)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.10:
  linux-image-2.6.35-30-generic   2.6.35-30.54
  linux-image-2.6.35-30-generic-pae  2.6.35-30.54
  linux-image-2.6.35-30-omap      2.6.35-30.54
  linux-image-2.6.35-30-powerpc   2.6.35-30.54
  linux-image-2.6.35-30-powerpc-smp  2.6.35-30.54
  linux-image-2.6.35-30-powerpc64-smp  2.6.35-30.54
  linux-image-2.6.35-30-server    2.6.35-30.54
  linux-image-2.6.35-30-versatile  2.6.35-30.54
  linux-image-2.6.35-30-virtual   2.6.35-30.54

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.
