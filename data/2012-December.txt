firefox regressions
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.10
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Regressions were introduced in the last Firefox update.

Software Description:
- firefox: Mozilla Open Source web browser

Details:

USN-1638-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. The new packages introduced
regressions in cookies handling and the User Agent string. This update fixes
the problem.

Original advisory details:

 Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bob Clary, Kyle Huey, Ed
 Morley, Chris Lord, Boris Zbarsky, Julian Seward, Bill McCloskey, and
 Andrew McCreight discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting
 Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an
 attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via
 application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the
 user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-5842, CVE-2012-5843)
 
 Atte Kettunen discovered a buffer overflow while rendering GIF format
 images. An attacker could exploit this to possibly execute arbitrary code
 as the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-4202)
 
 It was discovered that the evalInSandbox function's JavaScript sandbox
 context could be circumvented. An attacker could exploit this to perform a
 cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or steal a copy of a local file if the
 user has installed an add-on vulnerable to this attack. With cross-site
 scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially
 crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents,
 or steal confidential data, within the same domain. (CVE-2012-4201)
 
 Jonathan Stephens discovered that combining vectors involving the setting
 of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) properties in conjunction with SVG text
 could cause Firefox to crash. If a user were tricked into opening a
 malicious web page, an attacker could cause a denial of service via
 application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privliges of the user
 invoking the program. (CVE-2012-5836)
 
 It was discovered that if a javascript: URL is selected from the list of
 Firefox "new tab" page, the script will inherit the privileges of the
 privileged "new tab" page. This allows for the execution of locally
 installed programs if a user can be convinced to save a bookmark of a
 malicious javascript: URL. (CVE-2012-4203)
 
 Scott Bell discovered a memory corruption issue in the JavaScript engine.
 If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website, an attacker could
 exploit this to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of
 another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.
 (CVE-2012-4204)
 
 Gabor Krizsanits discovered that XMLHttpRequest objects created within
 sandboxes have the system principal instead of the sandbox principal. This
 can lead to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) or information theft via an
 add-on running untrusted code in a sandbox. (CVE-2012-4205)
 
 Peter Van der Beken discovered XrayWrapper implementation in Firefox does
 not consider the compartment during property filtering. An attacker could
 use this to bypass intended chrome-only restrictions on reading DOM object
 properties via a crafted web site. (CVE-2012-4208)
 
 Bobby Holley discovered that cross-origin wrappers were allowing write
 actions on objects when only read actions should have been properly
 allowed. This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. With
 cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a
 specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the
 contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain.
 (CVE-2012-5841)
 
 Masato Kinugawa discovered that when HZ-GB-2312 charset encoding is used
 for text, the "~" character will destroy another character near the chunk
 delimiter. This can lead to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack in pages
 encoded in HZ-GB-2312. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user
 were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could
 exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within
 the same domain. (CVE-2012-4207)
 
 Masato Kinugawa discovered that scripts entered into the Developer Toolbar
 could run in a chrome privileged context. An attacker could use this
 vulnerability to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or execute
 arbitrary code as the user invoking Firefox. With cross-site scripting
 vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted
 page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or
 steal confidential data, within the same domain. (CVE-2012-5837)
 
 Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the location property can be accessed by
 binary plugins through top.location with a frame whose name attribute's
 value is set to "top". This can allow for possible cross-site scripting
 (XSS) attacks through plugins. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,
 if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote
 attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential
 data, within the same domain. (CVE-2012-4209)
 
 Mariusz Mlynski discovered that when a maliciously crafted stylesheet is
 inspected in the Style Inspector, HTML and CSS can run in a chrome
 privileged context without being properly sanitized first. If a user were
 tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could execute
 arbitrary code with the privliges of the user invoking the program.
 (CVE-2012-4210)
 
 Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free and buffer overflow issues
 in Firefox. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious page, an
 attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking
 the program. (CVE-2012-4214, CVE-2012-4215, CVE-2012-4216, CVE-2012-5829,
 CVE-2012-5839, CVE-2012-5840, CVE-2012-4212, CVE-2012-4213, CVE-2012-4217,
 CVE-2012-4218)
 
 Several memory corruption flaws were discovered in Firefox. If a user were
 tricked into opening a malicious page, an attacker could exploit these to
 execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. (CVE-2012-5830,
 CVE-2012-5833, CVE-2012-5835, CVE-2012-5838)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.10:
  firefox                         17.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.12.10.1

Subject: [USN-1653-1] Linux kernel (EC2) vulnerability
Message-ID: <50BE7348.3060508@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1653-1
December 04, 2012

linux-ec2 vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

The system could be made to run programs as an administrator.

Software Description:
- linux-ec2: Linux kernel for EC2

Details:

Rodrigo Freire discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel's TCP illinois
congestion control algorithm. A local attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-350-ec2      2.6.32-350.57

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.10
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

MoinMoin could be made to run programs and overwrite files.

Software Description:
- moin: Collaborative hypertext environment

Details:

It was discovered that MoinMoin did not properly sanitize its input when
processing AnyWikiDraw and TWikiDraw actions. A remote attacker with write
access could exploit this to overwrite arbitrary files and execute
arbitrary code with the priviliges of the web server (user 'www-data').

It was discovered that MoinMoin also did not properly sanitize its input
when processing the AttachFile action. A remote attacker could exploit
this to overwrite files via directory traversal.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.10:
  python-moinmoin                 1.9.3-1ubuntu3.1

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
