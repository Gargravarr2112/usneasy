Message-ID: <1317429524.25355.0.camel@localhost>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1223-1
September 30, 2011

puppet vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Puppet could be made to overwrite files and run programs with administrator
privileges.

Software Description:
- puppet: Centralized configuration management

Details:

It was discovered that Puppet unsafely opened files when the k5login type
is used to manage files. A local attacker could exploit this to overwrite
arbitrary files which could be used to escalate privileges. (CVE-2011-3869)

Ricky Zhou discovered that Puppet did not drop privileges when creating
SSH authorized_keys files. A local attacker could exploit this to overwrite
arbitrary files as root. (CVE-2011-3870)

It was discovered that Puppet used a predictable filename when using the
--edit resource. A local attacker could exploit this to edit arbitrary
files or run arbitrary code as the user invoking the program, typically
root. (CVE-2011-3871)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.04:
  puppet-common                   2.6.4-2ubuntu2.3

Ubuntu 10.10:
  puppet-common                   2.6.1-0ubuntu2.2

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  puppet-common                   0.25.4-2ubuntu6.3

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

mozvoikko, ubufox, webfav update
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.04

Summary:

This update provides packages compatible with Firefox 7.

Software Description:
- mozvoikko: Finnish spell-checker extension for Firefox
- ubufox: Ubuntu Firefox specific configuration defaults and apt support
- webfav: Firefox extension for saving web favorites (bookmarks)

Details:

USN-1222-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. This update provides updated
packages for use with Firefox 7.

Original advisory details:

 Benjamin Smedberg, Bob Clary, Jesse Ruderman, Bob Clary, Andrew McCreight,
 Andreas Gal, Gary Kwong, Igor Bukanov, Jason Orendorff, Jesse Ruderman, and
 Marcia Knous discovered multiple memory vulnerabilities in the browser
 rendering engine. An attacker could use these to possibly execute arbitrary
 code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2011-2995,
 CVE-2011-2997)
 
 Boris Zbarsky discovered that a frame named "location" could shadow the
 window.location object unless a script in a page grabbed a reference to the
 true object before the frame was created. This is in violation of the Same
 Origin Policy. A malicious website could possibly use this to access
 another website or the local file system. (CVE-2011-2999)
 
 Ian Graham discovered that when multiple Location headers were present,
 Firefox would use the second one resulting in a possible CRLF injection
 attack. CRLF injection issues can result in a wide variety of attacks, such
 as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities, browser cache poisoning, and
 cookie theft. (CVE-2011-3000)
 
 Mariusz Mlynski discovered that if the user could be convinced to hold down
 the enter key, a malicious website could potential pop up a download dialog
 and the default open action would be selected or lead to the installation
 of an arbitrary add-on. This would result in potentially malicious content
 being run with privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2011-2372,
 CVE-2011-3001)
 
 Michael Jordon and Ben Hawkes discovered flaws in WebGL. If a user were
 tricked into opening a malicious page, an attacker could cause the browser
 to crash. (CVE-2011-3002, CVE-2011-3003)
 
 It was discovered that Firefox did not properly free memory when processing
 ogg files. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious page, an
 attacker could cause the browser to crash. (CVE-2011-3005)
 
 David Rees and Aki Helin discovered a problems in the JavaScript engine. An
 attacker could exploit this to crash the browser or potentially escalate
 privileges within the browser. (CVE-2011-3232)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.04:
  xul-ext-mozvoikko               1.10.0-0ubuntu0.11.04.1
  xul-ext-ubufox                  0.9.2-0ubuntu0.11.04.1
  xul-ext-webfav                  1.17-0ubuntu5.2

After a standard system update you need to restart Firefox to make all the
necessary changes.

linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.04

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-ti-omap4: Linux kernel for OMAP4

Details:

Timo Warns discovered that the EFI GUID partition table was not correctly
parsed. A physically local attacker that could insert mountable devices
could exploit this to crash the system or possibly gain root privileges.
(CVE-2011-1776)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the IPv4 diagnostic routines did not
correctly validate certain requests. A local attacker could exploit this to
consume CPU resources, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2213)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the Bluetooth stack incorrectly handled
certain L2CAP requests. If a system was using Bluetooth, a remote attacker
could send specially crafted traffic to crash the system or gain root
privileges. (CVE-2011-2497)

It was discovered that the EXT4 filesystem contained multiple off-by-one
flaws. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to
a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2695)

Mauro Carvalho Chehab discovered that the si4713 radio driver did not
correctly check the length of memory copies. If this hardware was
available, a local attacker could exploit this to crash the system or gain
root privileges. (CVE-2011-2700)

Herbert Xu discovered that certain fields were incorrectly handled when
Generic Receive Offload (CVE-2011-2723)

Time Warns discovered that long symlinks were incorrectly handled on Be
filesystems. A local attacker could exploit this with a malformed Be
filesystem and crash the system, leading to a denial of service.
(CVE-2011-2928)

Dan Kaminsky discovered that the kernel incorrectly handled random sequence
number generation. An attacker could use this flaw to possibly predict
sequence numbers and inject packets. (CVE-2011-3188)

Darren Lavender discovered that the CIFS client incorrectly handled certain
large values. A remote attacker with a malicious server could exploit this
to crash the system or possibly execute arbitrary code as the root user.
(CVE-2011-3191)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.04:
  linux-image-2.6.38-1209-omap4   2.6.38-1209.16

php5 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in PHP.

Software Description:
- php5: HTML-embedded scripting language interpreter

Details:

Mateusz Kocielski, Marek Kroemeke and Filip Palian discovered that a
stack-based buffer overflow existed in the socket_connect function's
handling of long pathnames for AF_UNIX sockets. A remote attacker
might be able to exploit this to execute arbitrary code; however,
the default compiler options for affected releases should reduce
the vulnerability to a denial of service. This issue affected Ubuntu
10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.10 and Ubuntu 11.04. (CVE-2011-1938)

Krzysztof Kotowicz discovered that the PHP post handler function
does not properly restrict filenames in multipart/form-data POST
requests. This may allow remote attackers to conduct absolute
path traversal attacks and possibly create or overwrite arbitrary
files. This issue affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu
10.10 and Ubuntu 11.04. (CVE-2011-2202)

It was discovered that the crypt function for blowfish does not
properly handle 8-bit characters. This could make it easier for an
attacker to discover a cleartext password containing an 8-bit character
that has a matching blowfish crypt value. This issue affected Ubuntu
10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.10 and Ubuntu 11.04. (CVE-2011-2483)

It was discovered that PHP did not properly check the return values of
the malloc(3), calloc(3) and realloc(3) library functions in multiple
locations. This could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service
via a NULL pointer dereference or possibly execute arbitrary code.
This issue affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.10
and Ubuntu 11.04. (CVE-2011-3182)

Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered that PHP did not properly implement
the error_log function. This could allow an attacker to cause a denial
of service via an application crash. This issue affected Ubuntu 10.04
LTS, Ubuntu 10.10, Ubuntu 11.04 and Ubuntu 11.10. (CVE-2011-3267)

Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered that the ZipArchive functions
addGlob() and addPattern() did not properly check their flag arguments.
This could allow a malicious script author to cause a denial of
service via application crash. This issue affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS,
Ubuntu 10.10, Ubuntu 11.04 and Ubuntu 11.10. (CVE-2011-1657)

It was discovered that the Xend opcode parser in PHP could be interrupted
while handling the shift-left, shift-right, and bitwise-xor opcodes.
This could allow a malicious script author to expose memory
contents. This issue affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. (CVE-2010-1914)

It was discovered that the strrchr function in PHP could be interrupted
by a malicious script, allowing the exposure of memory contents. This
issue affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. (CVE-2010-2484)

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1192-3
October 19, 2011

libvoikko regression
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.04

Summary:

A regression caused Firefox to crash while spell checking in Finnish.

Software Description:
- libvoikko: Library of Finnish language tools

Details:

USN-1192-1 provided Firefox 6 as a security upgrade. Unfortunately, this
caused a regression in libvoikko which caused Firefox to crash while spell
checking words with hyphens. This update corrects the issue. We apologize
for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Aral Yaman discovered a vulnerability in the WebGL engine. An attacker
 could potentially use this to crash Firefox or execute arbitrary code with
 the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2011-2989)
 
 Vivekanand Bolajwar discovered a vulnerability in the JavaScript engine. An
 attacker could potentially use this to crash Firefox or execute arbitrary
 code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2011-2991)
 
 Bert Hubert and Theo Snelleman discovered a vulnerability in the Ogg
 reader. An attacker could potentially use this to crash Firefox or execute
 arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.
 (CVE-2011-2991)
 
 Robert Kaiser, Jesse Ruderman, Gary Kwong, Christoph Diehl, Martijn
 Wargers, Travis Emmitt, Bob Clary, and Jonathan Watt discovered multiple
 memory vulnerabilities in the browser rendering engine. An attacker could
 use these to possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
 user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2011-2985)
 
 Rafael Gieschke discovered that unsigned JavaScript could call into a
 script inside a signed JAR. This could allow an attacker to execute
 arbitrary code with the identity and permissions of the signed JAR.
 (CVE-2011-2993)
 
 Michael Jordon discovered that an overly long shader program could cause a
 buffer overrun. An attacker could potentially use this to crash Firefox or
 execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.
 (CVE-2011-2988)
 
 Michael Jordon discovered a heap overflow in the ANGLE library used in
 Firefox's WebGL implementation. An attacker could potentially use this to
 crash Firefox or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
 invoking Firefox. (CVE-2011-2987)
 
 It was discovered that an SVG text manipulation routine contained a
 dangling pointer vulnerability. An attacker could potentially use this to
 crash Firefox or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
 invoking Firefox. (CVE-2011-0084)
 
 Mike Cardwell discovered that Content Security Policy violation reports
 failed to strip out proxy authorization credentials from the list of
 request headers. This could allow a malicious website to capture proxy
 authorization credentials. Daniel Veditz discovered that redirecting to a
 website with Content Security Policy resulted in the incorrect resolution
 of hosts in the constructed policy. This could allow a malicious website to
 circumvent the Content Security Policy of another website. (CVE-2011-2990)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.04:
  libvoikko1                      3.1-1ubuntu0.1

After a standard system update you need to restart Firefox to make
all the necessary changes.

puppet vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

The Puppet master server could be impersonated in certain configurations.

Software Description:
- puppet: Centralized configuration management

Details:

It was discovered that Puppet incorrectly handled the non-default
"certdnsnames" option when generating certificates. If this setting was
added to puppet.conf, the puppet master?s DNS alt names were added to the
X.509 Subject Alternative Name field of all certificates, not just the
puppet master?s certificate. An attacker that has an incorrect agent
certificate in his possession can use it to impersonate the puppet master
in a man-in-the-middle attack.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  puppet-common                   2.7.1-1ubuntu3.2

Ubuntu 11.04:
  puppet-common                   2.6.4-2ubuntu2.5

Ubuntu 10.10:
  puppet-common                   2.6.1-0ubuntu2.4

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  puppet-common                   0.25.4-2ubuntu6.5

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

If your puppet master's puppet.conf file has ever contained the
"certdnsnames" setting, you must reissue your site certificates, or apply
another mitigation technique. Please see the upstream advisory for more
information:

October 25, 2011

linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.10

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-ti-omap4: Linux kernel for OMAP4

Details:

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the Linux kernel X.25 implementation
incorrectly parsed facilities. A remote attacker could exploit this to
crash the kernel, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2010-3873)

Andrea Righi discovered a race condition in the KSM memory merging support.
If KSM was being used, a local attacker could exploit this to crash the
system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2183)

Vasily Averin discovered that the NFS Lock Manager (NLM) incorrectly
handled unlock requests. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a
denial of service. (CVE-2011-2491)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that taskstats did not enforce access
restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to read certain
information, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-2494)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that /proc/PID/io did not enforce access
restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to read certain
information, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-2495)

It was discovered that the wireless stack incorrectly verified SSID
lengths. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service
or gain root privileges. (CVE-2011-2517)

It was discovered that the EXT4 filesystem contained multiple off-by-one
flaws. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to
a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2695)

Christian Ohm discovered that the perf command looks for configuration
files in the current directory. If a privileged user were tricked into
running perf in a directory containing a malicious configuration file, an
attacker could run arbitrary commands and possibly gain privileges.
(CVE-2011-2905)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the Comedi driver did not correctly clear
memory. A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel stack memory,
leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-2909)

Yogesh Sharma discovered that CIFS did not correctly handle UNCs that had
no prefixpaths. A local attacker with access to a CIFS partition could
exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.
(CVE-2011-3363)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.10:
  linux-image-2.6.35-903-omap4    2.6.35-903.26

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

linux-mvl-dove vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-mvl-dove: Linux kernel for DOVE

Details:

Ryan Sweat discovered that the kernel incorrectly handled certain VLAN
packets. On some systems, a remote attacker could send specially crafted
traffic to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.
(CVE-2011-1576)

Vasiliy Kulikov and Dan Rosenberg discovered that ecryptfs did not
correctly check the origin of mount points. A local attacker could exploit
this to trick the system into unmounting arbitrary mount points, leading to
a denial of service. (CVE-2011-1833)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that taskstats did not enforce access
restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to read certain
information, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-2494)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that /proc/PID/io did not enforce access
restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to read certain
information, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-2495)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the Bluetooth stack incorrectly handled
certain L2CAP requests. If a system was using Bluetooth, a remote attacker
could send specially crafted traffic to crash the system or gain root
privileges. (CVE-2011-2497)

It was discovered that the EXT4 filesystem contained multiple off-by-one
flaws. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to
a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2695)

Fernando Gont discovered that the IPv6 stack used predictable fragment
identification numbers. A remote attacker could exploit this to exhaust
network resources, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2699)

Christian Ohm discovered that the perf command looks for configuration
files in the current directory. If a privileged user were tricked into
running perf in a directory containing a malicious configuration file, an
attacker could run arbitrary commands and possibly gain privileges.
(CVE-2011-2905)

Time Warns discovered that long symlinks were incorrectly handled on Be
filesystems. A local attacker could exploit this with a malformed Be
filesystem and crash the system, leading to a denial of service.
(CVE-2011-2928)

Dan Kaminsky discovered that the kernel incorrectly handled random sequence
number generation. An attacker could use this flaw to possibly predict
sequence numbers and inject packets. (CVE-2011-3188)

Darren Lavender discovered that the CIFS client incorrectly handled certain
large values. A remote attacker with a malicious server could exploit this
to crash the system or possibly execute arbitrary code as the root user.
(CVE-2011-3191)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-219-dove     2.6.32-219.37

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Subject: [USN-1246-1] Linux kernel vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <1319555092.11244.50.camel@mdlinux>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1246-1
October 25, 2011

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.04

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the IPv4 diagnostic routines did not
correctly validate certain requests. A local attacker could exploit this to
consume CPU resources, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2213)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the Bluetooth stack incorrectly handled
certain L2CAP requests. If a system was using Bluetooth, a remote attacker
could send specially crafted traffic to crash the system or gain root
privileges. (CVE-2011-2497)

It was discovered that the EXT4 filesystem contained multiple off-by-one
flaws. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to
a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2695)

Mauro Carvalho Chehab discovered that the si4713 radio driver did not
correctly check the length of memory copies. If this hardware was
available, a local attacker could exploit this to crash the system or gain
root privileges. (CVE-2011-2700)

Herbert Xu discovered that certain fields were incorrectly handled when
Generic Receive Offload (CVE-2011-2723)

Time Warns discovered that long symlinks were incorrectly handled on Be
filesystems. A local attacker could exploit this with a malformed Be
filesystem and crash the system, leading to a denial of service.
(CVE-2011-2928)

Dan Kaminsky discovered that the kernel incorrectly handled random sequence
number generation. An attacker could use this flaw to possibly predict
sequence numbers and inject packets. (CVE-2011-3188)

Darren Lavender discovered that the CIFS client incorrectly handled certain
large values. A remote attacker with a malicious server could exploit this
to crash the system or possibly execute arbitrary code as the root user.
(CVE-2011-3191)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.04:
  linux-image-2.6.38-12-generic   2.6.38-12.51
  linux-image-2.6.38-12-generic-pae  2.6.38-12.51
  linux-image-2.6.38-12-omap      2.6.38-12.51
  linux-image-2.6.38-12-powerpc   2.6.38-12.51
  linux-image-2.6.38-12-powerpc-smp  2.6.38-12.51
  linux-image-2.6.38-12-powerpc64-smp  2.6.38-12.51
  linux-image-2.6.38-12-server    2.6.38-12.51
  linux-image-2.6.38-12-versatile  2.6.38-12.51
  linux-image-2.6.38-12-virtual   2.6.38-12.51

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Message-ID: <1319564455.16989.6.camel@localhost>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1247-1
October 25, 2011

nova vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10

Summary:

Nova could be made to expose sensitive information.

Software Description:
- nova: OpenStack Compute cloud infrastructure

Details:

An information leak was discovered in Nova. An attacker with access to a
valid EC2_ACCESS_KEY could obtain the corresponding EC2_SECRET_KEY for that
user.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  python-nova                     2011.3-0ubuntu6.2

Subject: [USN-1238-2] Puppet regression
Message-ID: <1319569869.23929.3.camel@mdlinux>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1238-2
October 25, 2011

puppet regression
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.04

Summary:

USN-1238-1 caused a regression on Ubuntu 11.04.

Software Description:
- puppet: Centralized configuration management

Details:

USN-1238-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Puppet. The upstream patch introduced a
regression in Ubuntu 11.04 when executing certain commands. This update
fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that Puppet incorrectly handled the non-default
 "certdnsnames" option when generating certificates. If this setting was
 added to puppet.conf, the puppet master?s DNS alt names were added to the
 X.509 Subject Alternative Name field of all certificates, not just the
 puppet master?s certificate. An attacker that has an incorrect agent
 certificate in his possession can use it to impersonate the puppet master
 in a man-in-the-middle attack.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.04:
  puppet-common                   2.6.4-2ubuntu2.6

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

Subject: [USN-1248-1] KDE-Libs vulnerability
Message-ID: <1319581676.16989.7.camel@localhost>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1248-1
October 25, 2011

kde4libs vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

KDE-Libs could improperly display fraudulent security certificates.

Software Description:
- kde4libs: KDE 4 core applications and libraries

Details:

Tim Brown discovered that KSSL in KDE-Libs did not properly perform input
validation when displaying the common name (CN) for an SSL certificate. An
attacker could exploit this to spoof the common name which could be used in
an attack to trick the user into accepting a fraudulent certificate. This
issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and Ubuntu 10.10. (CVE-2011-3365)

It was discovered that KIO in KDE-Libs did not properly perform input
validation during proxy authentication. An attacker could exploit this to
modify displaying of the realm and proxy URL.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.04:
  libkio5                         4:4.6.5-0ubuntu1.1

Ubuntu 10.10:
  libkio5                         4:4.5.5-0ubuntu2.1

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  kdelibs5                        4:4.4.5-0ubuntu1.2

After a standard system update you need to restart any applications that
use KSSL and KIO, such as Konqueror and Rekong, to make all the necessary
changes.
