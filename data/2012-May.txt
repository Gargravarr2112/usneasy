Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1431-1
May 01, 2012

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

A flaw was found in the Linux's kernels ext4 file system when mounted with
a journal. A local, unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a
denial of service. (CVE-2011-4086)

Sasha Levin discovered a flaw in the permission checking for device
assignments requested via the kvm ioctl in the Linux kernel. A local user
could use this flaw to crash the system causing a denial of service.
(CVE-2011-4347)

Stephan B??rwolf discovered a flaw in the KVM (kernel-based virtual
machine) subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local unprivileged user can crash
use this flaw to crash VMs causing a deny of service. (CVE-2012-0045)

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's cifs file system. An
unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to crash the system leading
to a denial of service. (CVE-2012-1090)

H. Peter Anvin reported a flaw in the Linux kernel that could crash the
system. A local user could exploit this flaw to crash the system.
(CVE-2012-1097)

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's cgroups subset. A local
attacker could use this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2012-1146)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's handling of paged memory. A local
unprivileged user, or a privileged user within a KVM guest, could exploit
this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2012-1179)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  linux-image-3.0.0-19-generic    3.0.0-19.33
  linux-image-3.0.0-19-generic-pae  3.0.0-19.33
  linux-image-3.0.0-19-omap       3.0.0-19.33
  linux-image-3.0.0-19-powerpc    3.0.0-19.33
  linux-image-3.0.0-19-powerpc-smp  3.0.0-19.33
  linux-image-3.0.0-19-powerpc64-smp  3.0.0-19.33
  linux-image-3.0.0-19-server     3.0.0-19.33
  linux-image-3.0.0-19-virtual    3.0.0-19.33

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

thunderbird vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird.

Software Description:
- thunderbird: Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

Details:

USN-1430-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. This update provides the
corresponding fixes for Thunderbird.

Original advisory details:

 Bob Clary, Christian Holler, Brian Hackett, Bobby Holley, Gary Kwong,
 Hilary Hall, Honza Bambas, Jesse Ruderman, Julian Seward, and Olli Pettay
 discovered memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were tricked
 into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit these to
 cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute
 code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-0467,
 CVE-2012-0468)
 
 Aki Helin discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in XPConnect. An
 attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the
 privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-0469)
 
 Atte Kettunen discovered that invalid frees cause heap corruption in
 gfxImageSurface. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious Scalable
 Vector Graphics (SVG) image file, an attacker could exploit these to cause
 a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with
 the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-0470)
 
 Anne van Kesteren discovered a potential cross-site scripting (XSS)
 vulnerability via multibyte content processing errors. With cross-site
 scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially
 crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents,
 or steal confidential data, within the same domain. (CVE-2012-0471)
 
 Matias Juntunen discovered a vulnerability in Firefox's WebGL
 implementation that potentially allows the reading of illegal video memory.
 An attacker could possibly exploit this to cause a denial of service via
 application crash. (CVE-2012-0473)
 
 Jordi Chancel, Eddy Bordi, and Chris McGowen discovered that Firefox
 allowed the address bar to display a different website than the one the
 user was visiting. This could potentially leave the user vulnerable to
 cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. With cross-site scripting
 vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted
 page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal
 confidential data, within the same domain. (CVE-2012-0474)
 
 Simone Fabiano discovered that Firefox did not always send correct origin
 headers when connecting to an IPv6 websites. An attacker could potentially
 use this to bypass intended access controls. (CVE-2012-0475)
 
 Masato Kinugawa discovered that cross-site scripting (XSS) injection is
 possible during the decoding of ISO-2022-KR and ISO-2022-CN character sets.
 With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into
 viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to
 modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain.
 (CVE-2012-0477)
 
 It was discovered that certain images rendered using WebGL could cause
 Firefox to crash. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted
 page, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via
 application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the
 user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-0478)
 
 Mateusz Jurczyk discovered an off-by-one error in the OpenType Sanitizer.
 If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker
 could exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or
 potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.
 (CVE-2011-3062)
 
 Daniel Divricean discovered a defect in the error handling of JavaScript
 errors can potentially leak the file names and location of JavaScript files
 on a server. This could potentially lead to inadvertent information
 disclosure and a vector for further attacks. (CVE-2011-1187)
 
 Jeroen van der Gun discovered a vulnerability in the way Firefox handled
 RSS and Atom feeds. Invalid RSS or ATOM content loaded over HTTPS caused
 the location bar to be updated with the address of this content, while the
 main window still displays the previously loaded content. An attacker could
 potentially exploit this vulnerability to conduct phishing attacks.
 (CVE-2012-0479)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  thunderbird                     12.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1

Ubuntu 11.10:
  thunderbird                     12.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.11.10.1

Ubuntu 11.04:
  thunderbird                     12.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.11.04.1

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  thunderbird                     12.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.10.04.1

After a standard system update you need to restart Thunderbird to make
all the necessary changes.

Subject: [USN-1437-1] PHP vulnerability
Message-ID: <20120504202458.GC9185@nxnw.org>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1437-1
May 04, 2012

php5 vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

Summary:

Standalone PHP CGI scripts could be made to execute arbitrary code with
the privilege of the web server.

Software Description:
- php5: HTML-embedded scripting language interpreter

Details:

It was discovered that PHP, when used as a stand alone CGI processor
for the Apache Web Server, did not properly parse and filter query
strings. This could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code
running with the privilege of the web server. Configurations using
mod_php5 and FastCGI were not vulnerable.

This update addresses the issue when the PHP CGI interpreter
is configured using mod_cgi and mod_actions as described
in /usr/share/doc/php5-cgi/README.Debian.gz; however,
if an alternate configuration is used to enable PHP CGI
processing, it should be reviewed to ensure that command line
arguments cannot be passed to the PHP interpreter. Please see
http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2012/CVE-2012-2311.html
for more details and potential mitigation approaches.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  php5-cgi                        5.3.10-1ubuntu3.1

Ubuntu 11.10:
  php5-cgi                        5.3.6-13ubuntu3.7

Ubuntu 11.04:
  php5-cgi                        5.3.5-1ubuntu7.8

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  php5-cgi                        5.3.2-1ubuntu4.15

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS:
  php5-cgi                        5.2.4-2ubuntu5.24

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1432-1
May 08, 2012

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.04

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

A flaw was found in the Linux's kernels ext4 file system when mounted with
a journal. A local, unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a
denial of service. (CVE-2011-4086)

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's cifs file system. An
unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to crash the system leading
to a denial of service. (CVE-2012-1090)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ext4 file system when mounting a
corrupt filesystem. A user-assisted remote attacker could exploit this flaw
to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-2100)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.04:
  linux-image-2.6.38-15-generic   2.6.38-15.59
  linux-image-2.6.38-15-generic-pae  2.6.38-15.59
  linux-image-2.6.38-15-omap      2.6.38-15.59
  linux-image-2.6.38-15-powerpc   2.6.38-15.59
  linux-image-2.6.38-15-powerpc-smp  2.6.38-15.59
  linux-image-2.6.38-15-powerpc64-smp  2.6.38-15.59
  linux-image-2.6.38-15-server    2.6.38-15.59
  linux-image-2.6.38-15-versatile  2.6.38-15.59
  linux-image-2.6.38-15-virtual   2.6.38-15.59

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

sudo vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

Summary:

Sudo could allow users to run arbitrary programs as the administrator.

Software Description:
- sudo: Provide limited super user privileges to specific users

Details:

It was discovered that sudo incorrectly handled network masks when using Host
and Host_List. A local user who is listed in sudoers may be allowed to run
commands on unintended hosts when IPv4 network masks are used to grant access.
A local attacker could exploit this to bypass intended access restrictions. Host
and Host_List are not used in the default installation of Ubuntu.

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1445-1
May 18, 2012

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

A flaw was found in the Linux's kernels ext4 file system when mounted with
a journal. A local, unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a
denial of service. (CVE-2011-4086)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) virtual
cpu setup. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to crash the
system leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2012-1601)

Steve Grubb reported a flaw with Linux fscaps (file system base
capabilities) when used to increase the permissions of a process. For
application on which fscaps are in use a local attacker can disable address
space randomization to make attacking the process with raised privileges
easier. (CVE-2012-2123)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-41-386       2.6.32-41.89

Software Description:
- libxml2: GNOME XML library

Details:

Juri Aedla discovered that libxml2 contained an off by one error in its
XPointer functionality. If a user or application linked against libxml2
were tricked into opening a specially crafted XML file, an attacker could
cause the application to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking the program.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Message-ID: <4FBFDF94.2050708@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1453-1
May 25, 2012

linux-ec2 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-ec2: Linux kernel for EC2

Details:

A flaw was found in the Linux's kernels ext4 file system when mounted with
a journal. A local, unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a
denial of service. (CVE-2011-4086)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) virtual
cpu setup. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to crash the
system leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2012-1601)

Steve Grubb reported a flaw with Linux fscaps (file system base
capabilities) when used to increase the permissions of a process. For
application on which fscaps are in use a local attacker can disable address
space randomization to make attacking the process with raised privileges
easier. (CVE-2012-2123)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-345-ec2      2.6.32-345.48

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

linux-lts-backport-oneiric vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-lts-backport-oneiric: Linux kernel backport from Oneiric

Details:

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) virtual
cpu setup. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to crash the
system leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2012-1601)

  linux-image-3.0.0-20-virtual    3.0.0-20.34~lucid1

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.
