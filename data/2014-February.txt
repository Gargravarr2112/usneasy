Subject: [USN-2098-2] LibYAML regression
Message-ID: <52FCF470.9040909@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2098-2
February 13, 2014

libyaml regression
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 13.10
- Ubuntu 12.10
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

USN-2098-1 introduced a regression in LibYAML.

Software Description:
- libyaml: Fast YAML 1.1 parser and emitter library

Details:

USN-2098-1 fixed a vulnerability in LibYAML. The security fix used
introduced a regression that caused parsing failures for certain valid YAML
files. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Florian Weimer discovered that LibYAML incorrectly handled certain large
 yaml documents. An attacker could use this issue to cause LibYAML to crash,
 resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 13.10:
  libyaml-0-2                     0.1.4-2ubuntu0.13.10.2

Ubuntu 12.10:
  libyaml-0-2                     0.1.4-2ubuntu0.12.10.2

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  libyaml-0-2                     0.1.4-2ubuntu0.12.04.2

After a standard system update you need to restart applications using
LibYAML to make all the necessary changes.

maas vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 13.10
- Ubuntu 12.10
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

The cluster could be made to run programs as an administrator.

Software Description:
- maas: Ubuntu MAAS Server

Details:

James Troup discovered that MAAS stored RabbitMQ authentication
credentials in a world-readable file. A local authenticated user
could read this password and potentially gain privileges of other
user accounts. This update restricts the file permissions to prevent
unintended access. (CVE-2013-1070)

Chris Glass discovered that the MAAS API was vulnerable to cross-site
scripting vulnerabilities. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,
if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote
attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential
data, within the same domain. (CVE-2013-1069)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 13.10:
  maas-region-controller          1.4+bzr1693+dfsg-0ubuntu2.3
  python-django-maas              1.4+bzr1693+dfsg-0ubuntu2.3

Ubuntu 12.10:
  maas-region-controller          1.2+bzr1373+dfsg-0ubuntu1.2
  python-django-maas              1.2+bzr1373+dfsg-0ubuntu1.2

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  maas-region-controller          1.2+bzr1373+dfsg-0ubuntu1~12.04.5
  python-django-maas              1.2+bzr1373+dfsg-0ubuntu1~12.04.5

After a standard system update you need to restart apache2 to make all
the necessary changes.

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's compat ioctls for Adaptec
AACRAID scsi raid devices. An unprivileged local user could send
administrative commands to these devices potentially compromising the data
stored on the device. (CVE-2013-6383)

mpd reported an information leak in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg
system calls in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit
this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory.
(CVE-2013-7263)

mpb reported an information leak in the Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (l2tp)
of the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain
sensitive information from kernel stack memory. (CVE-2013-7264)

mpb reported an information leak in the Phone Network protocol (phonet) in
the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive
information from kernel stack memory. (CVE-2013-7265)

mpb reported an information leak in the Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area
Networks support (IEEE 802.15.4) in the Linux kernel. A local user could
exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory.
(CVE-2013-7281)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-56-386       2.6.32-56.118
  linux-image-2.6.32-56-generic   2.6.32-56.118

  linux-image-2.6.32-56-virtual   2.6.32-56.118

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Message-ID: <5303ED3D.9090909@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2111-1
February 18, 2014

linux-lts-quantal vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-lts-quantal: Linux hardware enablement kernel from Quantal

Details:

Vasily Kulikov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's implementation of
ptrace. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain
sensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2013-2929)

A flaw in the handling of memory regions of the kernel virtual machine
(KVM) subsystem was discovered. A local user with the ability to assign a
device could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory
consumption). (CVE-2013-4592)

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's
debugfs filesystem. An administrative local user could exploit this flaw to
cause a denial of service (OOPS). (CVE-2013-6378)

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the driver for Adaptec
AACRAID scsi raid devices in the Linux kernel. A local user could use this
flaw to cause a denial of service or possibly other unspecified impact.
(CVE-2013-6380)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.5.0-46-generic    3.5.0-46.70~precise1

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 13.10:
  linux-image-3.11.0-17-generic   3.11.0-17.31
  linux-image-3.11.0-17-generic-lpae  3.11.0-17.31

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.
