firefox vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in Firefox.

Software Description:
- firefox: Mozilla Open Source web browser

Details:

Jesse Ruderman, Igor Bukanov, Bill McCloskey, Christian Holler, Andrew
McCreight, Olli Pettay, Boris Zbarsky, and Brian Bondy discovered memory
safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a
specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a
denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with
the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-1937, CVE-2012-1938)

It was discovered that Mozilla's WebGL implementation exposed a bug in
certain NVIDIA graphics drivers. The impact of this issue has not been
disclosed at this time. (CVE-2011-3101)

Adam Barth discovered that certain inline event handlers were not being
blocked properly by the Content Security Policy's (CSP) inline-script
blocking feature. Web applications relying on this feature of CSP to
protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) were not fully protected. With
cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a
specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the
contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain.
(CVE-2012-1944)

Paul Stone discovered that a viewed HTML page hosted on a Windows or Samba
share could load Windows shortcut files (.lnk) in the same share. These
shortcut files could then link to arbitrary locations on the local file
system of the individual loading the HTML page. An attacker could
potentially use this vulnerability to show the contents of these linked
files or directories in an iframe, resulting in information disclosure.
(CVE-2012-1945)

Arthur Gerkis discovered a use-after-free vulnerability while
replacing/inserting a node in a document. If the user were tricked into
opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this
to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute
code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-1946)

Kaspar Brand discovered a vulnerability in how the Network Security
Services (NSS) ASN.1 decoder handles zero length items. If the user were
tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly
exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash.
(CVE-2012-0441)

Abhishek Arya discovered two buffer overflow and one use-after-free
vulnerabilities. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted
page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service
via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of
the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-1940, CVE-2012-1941, CVE-2012-1947)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  firefox                         13.0+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1

Ubuntu 11.10:
  firefox                         13.0+build1-0ubuntu0.11.10.1

Ubuntu 11.04:
  firefox                         13.0+build1-0ubuntu0.11.04.1

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  firefox                         13.0+build1-0ubuntu0.10.04.1

After a standard system update you need to restart Firefox to make
all the necessary changes.

ubuntuone-client regression
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Fraudulent security certificates could allow sensitive information to
be exposed when accessing the Internet.

Software Description:
- ubuntuone-client: Ubuntu One client

Details:

USN-1465-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Ubuntu One Client. The update failed to
install on certain Ubuntu 10.04 LTS systems that had a legacy Python 2.5
package installed. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that the Ubuntu One Client incorrectly validated server
 certificates when using HTTPS connections. If a remote attacker were able
 to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to
 alter or compromise confidential information.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  python-ubuntuone-client         1.2.2-0ubuntu2.3

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

nova vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 11.10

Summary:

Nova could be prevented from applying security group policy.

Software Description:

Details:

It was discovered that, when defining security groups in Nova using
the EC2 or OS APIs, specifying the network protocol (e.g. 'TCP') in
the incorrect case would cause the security group to not be applied
correctly. An attacker could use this to bypass Nova security group
restrictions.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  python-nova                     2012.1-0ubuntu2.2

Ubuntu 11.10:

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.0.0-21-generic    3.0.0-21.35~lucid1
  linux-image-3.0.0-21-generic-pae  3.0.0-21.35~lucid1

  linux-image-3.0.0-21-virtual    3.0.0-21.35~lucid1

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1466-2
June 12, 2012

nova regression
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 11.10

Summary:

USN 1466-1 introduced a regression in Nova.

Software Description:
- nova: OpenStack Compute cloud infrastructure

Details:

USN 1466-1 fixed a vulnerability in Nova. The upstream patch introduced
a regression when a security group granted full access and therefore the
network protocol was left unset, causing an error in processing. This
update fixes the issue.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that, when defining security groups in Nova using
 the EC2 or OS APIs, specifying the network protocol (e.g. 'TCP') in
 the incorrect case would cause the security group to not be applied
 correctly. An attacker could use this to bypass Nova security group
 restrictions.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  python-nova                     2012.1-0ubuntu2.3

Ubuntu 11.10:
  python-nova                     2011.3-0ubuntu6.8

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1473-1
June 13, 2012

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's KVM (kernel virtual machine).
An administrative user in the guest OS could leverage this flaw to cause a
denial of service in the host OS. (CVE-2012-2121)

Schacher Raindel discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel's memory handling
when hugetlb is enabled. An unprivileged local attacker could exploit this
flaw to cause a denial of service and potentially gain higher privileges.
(CVE-2012-2133)

Stephan Mueller reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's dl2k network driver's
handling of ioctls. An unprivileged local user could leverage this flaw to
cause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-2313)

Timo Warns reported multiple flaws in the Linux kernel's hfsplus
filesystem. An unprivileged local user could exploit these flaws to gain
root system priviliges. (CVE-2012-2319)

Xi Wang discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel's i915 graphics driver
handling of cliprect on 32 bit systems. An unprivileged local attacker
could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service or potentially gain
root privileges. (CVE-2012-2383)

Xi Wang discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel's i915 graphics driver
handling of buffer_count on 32 bit systems. An unprivileged local attacker
could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service or potentially gain
root privileges. (CVE-2012-2384)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.2.0-25-generic    3.2.0-25.40
  linux-image-3.2.0-25-generic-pae  3.2.0-25.40
  linux-image-3.2.0-25-highbank   3.2.0-25.40
  linux-image-3.2.0-25-omap       3.2.0-25.40
  linux-image-3.2.0-25-powerpc-smp  3.2.0-25.40
  linux-image-3.2.0-25-powerpc64-smp  3.2.0-25.40
  linux-image-3.2.0-25-virtual    3.2.0-25.40

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Subject: [USN-1475-1] APT update
Message-ID: <1339726812.30653.52.camel@localhost>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1475-1
June 15, 2012

apt update
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

Summary:

APT now more thoroughly verifies imported keyrings.

Software Description:
- apt: Advanced front-end for dpkg

Details:

Georgi Guninski discovered that APT relied on GnuPG argument order and did
not check GPG subkeys when validating imported keyrings via apt-key
net-update. While it appears that a man-in-the-middle attacker cannot
exploit this, as a hardening measure this update adjusts apt-key to
validate all subkeys when checking for key collisions.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  apt                             0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.1

Ubuntu 11.10:
  apt                             0.8.16~exp5ubuntu13.4

Ubuntu 11.04:
  apt                             0.8.13.2ubuntu4.5

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  apt                             0.7.25.3ubuntu9.12

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS:
  apt                             0.7.9ubuntu17.5

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

Summary:

An attacker could trick APT into installing altered packages.

Software Description:
- apt: Advanced front-end for dpkg

Details:

Georgi Guninski discovered that APT did not properly validate imported
keyrings via apt-key net-update. USN-1475-1 added additional verification
for imported keyrings, but it was insufficient. If a remote attacker were
able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could potentially be
used to install altered packages. This update corrects the issue by
disabling the net-update option completely. A future update will re-enable
the option with corrected verification.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  apt                             0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.2

Subject: [USN-1480-1] Raptor vulnerability
Message-ID: <1340035693.3336.11.camel@localhost>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1480-1
June 18, 2012

raptor vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Applications using Raptor could be made to expose sensitive information or
run programs as your login if they opened a specially crafted file.

Software Description:
- raptor: Raptor RDF parser and serializer library

Details:

Timothy D. Morgan discovered that Raptor would unconditionally load XML
external entities. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted
document in an application linked against Raptor, an attacker could
possibly obtain access to arbitrary files on the user's system or
potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
the program.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  libraptor1                      1.4.21-7ubuntu0.1

Ubuntu 11.10:
  libraptor1                      1.4.21-5ubuntu0.1

Ubuntu 11.04:
  libraptor1                      1.4.21-2ubuntu0.1

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  libraptor1                      1.4.21-1ubuntu1.1

After a standard system update you need to restart any applications which
use Raptor, such as OpenOffice.org or LibreOffice, to make all the
necessary changes.

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in PHP.

Software Description:
- php5: HTML-embedded scripting language interpreter

Details:

It was discovered that PHP incorrectly handled certain Tidy::diagnose
operations on invalid objects. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
cause PHP to crash, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2012-0781)

It was discovered that PHP incorrectly handled certain multi-file upload
filenames. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of
service, or to perform a directory traversal attack. (CVE-2012-1172)

Rubin Xu and Joseph Bonneau discovered that PHP incorrectly handled certain
Unicode characters in passwords passed to the crypt() function. A remote
attacker could possibly use this flaw to bypass authentication.
(CVE-2012-2143)

It was discovered that a Debian/Ubuntu specific patch caused PHP to
incorrectly handle empty salt strings. A remote attacker could possibly use
this flaw to bypass authentication. This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04
LTS and Ubuntu 11.04. (CVE-2012-2317)

It was discovered that PHP, when used as a stand alone CGI processor
for the Apache Web Server, did not properly parse and filter query
strings. This could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code
running with the privilege of the web server, or to perform a denial of
service. Configurations using mod_php5 and FastCGI were not vulnerable.
(CVE-2012-2335, CVE-2012-2336)

Alexander Gavrun discovered that the PHP Phar extension incorrectly handled
certain malformed TAR files. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
perform a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.

firefox regressions
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

USN-1463-1 introduced regressions in Firefox.

Software Description:
- firefox: Mozilla Open Source web browser

Details:

USN-1463-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. The new package caused a
regression in the rendering of Hebrew text and the ability of the Hotmail
inbox to auto-update. This update fixes the problem.

Original advisory details:

 Jesse Ruderman, Igor Bukanov, Bill McCloskey, Christian Holler, Andrew
 McCreight, Olli Pettay, Boris Zbarsky, and Brian Bondy discovered memory
 safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a
 specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a
 denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with
 the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-1937, CVE-2012-1938)
 
 It was discovered that Mozilla's WebGL implementation exposed a bug in
 certain NVIDIA graphics drivers. The impact of this issue has not been
 disclosed at this time. (CVE-2011-3101)
 
 Adam Barth discovered that certain inline event handlers were not being
 blocked properly by the Content Security Policy's (CSP) inline-script
 blocking feature. Web applications relying on this feature of CSP to
 protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) were not fully protected. With
 cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a
 specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the
 contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain.
 (CVE-2012-1944)
 
 Paul Stone discovered that a viewed HTML page hosted on a Windows or Samba
 share could load Windows shortcut files (.lnk) in the same share. These
 shortcut files could then link to arbitrary locations on the local file
 system of the individual loading the HTML page. An attacker could
 potentially use this vulnerability to show the contents of these linked
 files or directories in an iframe, resulting in information disclosure.
 (CVE-2012-1945)
 
 Arthur Gerkis discovered a use-after-free vulnerability while
 replacing/inserting a node in a document. If the user were tricked into
 opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this
 to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1463-4
June 22, 2012

thunderbird vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird.

Software Description:
- thunderbird: Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

Details:

USN-1463-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. This update provides the
corresponding fixes for Thunderbird.

Original advisory details:

 Jesse Ruderman, Igor Bukanov, Bill McCloskey, Christian Holler, Andrew
 McCreight, Olli Pettay, Boris Zbarsky, and Brian Bondy discovered memory
 safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a
 specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a
 denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with
 the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-1937, CVE-2012-1938)
 
 It was discovered that Mozilla's WebGL implementation exposed a bug in
 certain NVIDIA graphics drivers. The impact of this issue has not been
 disclosed at this time. (CVE-2011-3101)
 
 Adam Barth discovered that certain inline event handlers were not being
 blocked properly by the Content Security Policy's (CSP) inline-script
 blocking feature. Web applications relying on this feature of CSP to
 protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) were not fully protected. With
 cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a
 specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the
 contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain.
 (CVE-2012-1944)
 
 Paul Stone discovered that a viewed HTML page hosted on a Windows or Samba
 share could load Windows shortcut files (.lnk) in the same share. These
 shortcut files could then link to arbitrary locations on the local file
 system of the individual loading the HTML page. An attacker could
 potentially use this vulnerability to show the contents of these linked
 files or directories in an iframe, resulting in information disclosure.
 (CVE-2012-1945)
 
 Arthur Gerkis discovered a use-after-free vulnerability while
 replacing/inserting a node in a document. If the user were tricked into
 opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this
 to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute
 code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-1946)
 
 Kaspar Brand discovered a vulnerability in how the Network Security
 Services (NSS) ASN.1 decoder handles zero length items. If the user were
 tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly
 exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash.
 (CVE-2012-0441)
 
 Abhishek Arya discovered two buffer overflow and one use-after-free
 vulnerabilities. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted
 page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service
 via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of
 the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-1940, CVE-2012-1941, CVE-2012-1947)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  thunderbird                     13.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1

Ubuntu 11.10:
  thunderbird                     13.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.11.10.1

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  thunderbird                     13.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.10.04.1

After a standard system update you need to restart Thunderbird to make
all the necessary changes.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.
