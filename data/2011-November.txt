November 08, 2011

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Ryan Sweat discovered that the kernel incorrectly handled certain VLAN
packets. On some systems, a remote attacker could send specially crafted
traffic to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.
(CVE-2011-1576)

Vasiliy Kulikov and Dan Rosenberg discovered that ecryptfs did not
correctly check the origin of mount points. A local attacker could exploit
this to trick the system into unmounting arbitrary mount points, leading to
a denial of service. (CVE-2011-1833)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that taskstats did not enforce access
restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to read certain
information, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-2494)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that /proc/PID/io did not enforce access
restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to read certain
information, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-2495)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the Bluetooth stack incorrectly handled
certain L2CAP requests. If a system was using Bluetooth, a remote attacker
could send specially crafted traffic to crash the system or gain root
privileges. (CVE-2011-2497)

It was discovered that the EXT4 filesystem contained multiple off-by-one
flaws. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to
a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2695)

Fernando Gont discovered that the IPv6 stack used predictable fragment
identification numbers. A remote attacker could exploit this to exhaust
network resources, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2699)

Christian Ohm discovered that the perf command looks for configuration
files in the current directory. If a privileged user were tricked into
running perf in a directory containing a malicious configuration file, an
attacker could run arbitrary commands and possibly gain privileges.
(CVE-2011-2905)

Time Warns discovered that long symlinks were incorrectly handled on Be
filesystems. A local attacker could exploit this with a malformed Be
filesystem and crash the system, leading to a denial of service.
(CVE-2011-2928)

Dan Kaminsky discovered that the kernel incorrectly handled random sequence
number generation. An attacker could use this flaw to possibly predict
sequence numbers and inject packets. (CVE-2011-3188)

Darren Lavender discovered that the CIFS client incorrectly handled certain
large values. A remote attacker with a malicious server could exploit this
to crash the system or possibly execute arbitrary code as the root user.
(CVE-2011-3191)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-35-386       2.6.32-35.78
  linux-image-2.6.32-35-generic   2.6.32-35.78
  linux-image-2.6.32-35-generic-pae  2.6.32-35.78
  linux-image-2.6.32-35-ia64      2.6.32-35.78
  linux-image-2.6.32-35-lpia      2.6.32-35.78
  linux-image-2.6.32-35-powerpc   2.6.32-35.78
  linux-image-2.6.32-35-powerpc-smp  2.6.32-35.78
  linux-image-2.6.32-35-powerpc64-smp  2.6.32-35.78
  linux-image-2.6.32-35-preempt   2.6.32-35.78
  linux-image-2.6.32-35-server    2.6.32-35.78
  linux-image-2.6.32-35-sparc64   2.6.32-35.78
  linux-image-2.6.32-35-sparc64-smp  2.6.32-35.78
  linux-image-2.6.32-35-versatile  2.6.32-35.78
  linux-image-2.6.32-35-virtual   2.6.32-35.78

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that radvd incorrectly parsed the
ND_OPT_DNSSL_INFORMATION option. A remote attacker could exploit this with
a specially-crafted request and cause the radvd daemon to crash, or
possibly execute arbitrary code. The default compiler options for affected
releases should reduce the vulnerability to a denial of service. This issue
only affected Ubuntu 11.04 and 11.10. (CVE-2011-3601)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that radvd incorrectly filtered interface names
when creating certain files. A local attacker could exploit this to
overwrite certain files on the system, bypassing intended permissions.
(CVE-2011-3602)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that radvd incorrectly handled certain lengths.
A remote attacker could exploit this to cause the radvd daemon to crash,
resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2011-3604)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that radvd incorrectly handled delays when used
in unicast mode, which is not the default in Ubuntu. If used in unicast
mode, a remote attacker could cause radvd outages, resulting in a denial of
service. (CVE-2011-3605)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  radvd                           1:1.8-1ubuntu0.1

Ubuntu 11.04:
  radvd                           1:1.7-1ubuntu0.1

Ubuntu 10.10:
  radvd                           1:1.6-1ubuntu0.1

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  radvd                           1:1.3-1.1ubuntu0.1

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

- xulrunner-1.9.2: Mozilla Gecko runtime environment

Details:

It was discovered that CVE-2011-3004, which addressed possible privilege
escalation in addons, also affected Firefox 3.6. An attacker could
potentially exploit Firefox when an add-on was installed that used
loadSubscript in vulnerable ways. (CVE-2011-3647)

Yosuke Hasegawa discovered that the Mozilla browser engine mishandled
invalid sequences in the Shift-JIS encoding. A malicious website could
possibly use this flaw this to steal data or inject malicious scripts into
web content. (CVE-2011-3648)

Marc Schoenefeld discovered that using Firebug to profile a JavaScript file
with many functions would cause Firefox to crash. An attacker might be able
to exploit this without using the debugging APIs which would potentially
allow an attacker to remotely crash the browser. (CVE-2011-3650)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.10:
  firefox                         3.6.24+build2+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.10.1

Summary:

Multiple vulnerabilities and a regression were fixed in the Apache HTTP
server.

Software Description:
- apache2: Apache HTTP server
- apache2-mpm-itk: multiuser MPM for Apache 2.2

Details:

It was discovered that the mod_proxy module in Apache did not properly
interact with the RewriteRule and ProxyPassMatch pattern matches
in the configuration of a reverse proxy. This could allow remote
attackers to contact internal webservers behind the proxy that were
not intended for external exposure. (CVE-2011-3368)

Stefano Nichele discovered that the mod_proxy_ajp module in Apache when
used with mod_proxy_balancer in certain configurations could allow
remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a malformed HTTP
request. (CVE-2011-3348)

Samuel Montosa discovered that the ITK Multi-Processing Module for
Apache did not properly handle certain configuration sections that
specify NiceValue but not AssignUserID, preventing Apache from dropping
privileges correctly. This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu
10.10 and Ubuntu 11.04. (CVE-2011-1176)

USN 1199-1 fixed a vulnerability in the byterange filter of Apache. The
upstream patch introduced a regression in Apache when handling specific
byte range requests. This update fixes the issue.

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1260-1
November 14, 2011

linux-ti-omap4 vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10

Summary:

A security issue was fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-ti-omap4: Linux kernel for OMAP4

Details:

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that taskstats did not enforce access
restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to read certain
information, leading to a loss of privacy.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  linux-image-3.0.0-1206-omap4    3.0.0-1206.12

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Software Description:
- icedtea-web: A web browser plugin to execute Java applets
- openjdk-6: Open Source Java implementation
- openjdk-6b18: Open Source Java implementation

Details:

Deepak Bhole discovered a flaw in the Same Origin Policy (SOP)
implementation in the IcedTea web browser plugin. This could allow a
remote attacker to open connections to certain hosts that should
not be permitted. (CVE-2011-3377)

Juliano Rizzo and Thai Duong discovered that the block-wise AES
encryption algorithm block-wise as used in TLS/SSL was vulnerable to
a chosen-plaintext attack. This could allow a remote attacker to view
confidential data. (CVE-2011-3389)

It was discovered that a type confusion flaw existed in the in
the Internet Inter-Orb Protocol (IIOP) deserialization code. A
remote attacker could use this to cause an untrusted application
or applet to execute arbitrary code by deserializing malicious
input. (CVE-2011-3521)

It was discovered that the Java scripting engine did not perform
SecurityManager checks. This could allow a remote attacker to cause
an untrusted application or applet to execute arbitrary code with
the full privileges of the JVM. (CVE-2011-3544)

It was discovered that the InputStream class used a global buffer to
store input bytes skipped. An attacker could possibly use this to gain
access to sensitive information. (CVE-2011-3547)

It was discovered that a vulnerability existed in the AWTKeyStroke
class. A remote attacker could cause an untrusted application or applet
to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2011-3548)

It was discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed
in the TransformHelper class in the Java2D implementation. A remote
attacker could use this cause a denial of service via an application
or applet crash or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2011-3551)

It was discovered that the default number of available UDP sockets for
applications running under SecurityManager restrictions was set too
high. A remote attacker could use this with a malicious application or
applet exhaust the number of available UDP sockets to cause a denial
of service for other applets or applications running within the same
JVM. (CVE-2011-3552)

It was discovered that Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS) could
incorrectly expose a stack trace. A remote attacker could potentially
use this to gain access to sensitive information. (CVE-2011-3553)

It was discovered that the unpacker for pack200 JAR files did not
sufficiently check for errors. An attacker could cause a denial of
service or possibly execute arbitrary code through a specially crafted
pack200 JAR file. (CVE-2011-3554)

It was discovered that the RMI registration implementation did not
properly restrict privileges of remotely executed code. A remote
attacker could use this to execute code with elevated privileges.
(CVE-2011-3556, CVE-2011-3557)

It was discovered that the HotSpot VM could be made to crash, allowing
an attacker to cause a denial of service or possibly leak sensitive
information. (CVE-2011-3558)

It was discovered that the HttpsURLConnection class did not
properly perform SecurityManager checks in certain situations. This
could allow a remote attacker to bypass restrictions on HTTPS
connections. (CVE-2011-3560)

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

It was discovered that CIFS incorrectly handled authentication. When a user
had a CIFS share mounted that required authentication, a local user could
mount the same share without knowing the correct password. (CVE-2011-1585)

It was discovered that the GRE protocol incorrectly handled netns
initialization. A remote attacker could send a packet while the ip_gre
module was loading, and crash the system, leading to a denial of service.
(CVE-2011-1767)

It was discovered that the IP/IP protocol incorrectly handled netns
initialization. A remote attacker could send a packet while the ipip module
was loading, and crash the system, leading to a denial of service.
(CVE-2011-1768)

Vasily Averin discovered that the NFS Lock Manager (NLM) incorrectly
handled unlock requests. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a
denial of service. (CVE-2011-2491)

Robert Swiecki discovered that mapping extensions were incorrectly handled.
A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a
denial of service. (CVE-2011-2496)

Ben Pfaff discovered that Classless Queuing Disciplines (qdiscs) were being
incorrectly handled. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the
system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2525)

Yasuaki Ishimatsu discovered a flaw in the kernel's clock implementation. A
local unprivileged attacker could exploit this causing a denial of service.
(CVE-2011-3209)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.24-30-386       2.6.24-30.96
  linux-image-2.6.24-30-generic   2.6.24-30.96
  linux-image-2.6.24-30-hppa32    2.6.24-30.96
  linux-image-2.6.24-30-hppa64    2.6.24-30.96

  linux-image-2.6.24-30-lpia      2.6.24-30.96
  linux-image-2.6.24-30-lpiacompat  2.6.24-30.96
  linux-image-2.6.24-30-mckinley  2.6.24-30.96
  linux-image-2.6.24-30-openvz    2.6.24-30.96
  linux-image-2.6.24-30-powerpc   2.6.24-30.96
  linux-image-2.6.24-30-powerpc-smp  2.6.24-30.96
  linux-image-2.6.24-30-powerpc64-smp  2.6.24-30.96
  linux-image-2.6.24-30-rt        2.6.24-30.96
  linux-image-2.6.24-30-server    2.6.24-30.96
  linux-image-2.6.24-30-sparc64   2.6.24-30.96
  linux-image-2.6.24-30-sparc64-smp  2.6.24-30.96
  linux-image-2.6.24-30-virtual   2.6.24-30.96
  linux-image-2.6.24-30-xen       2.6.24-30.96

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1272-1
November 21, 2011

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.10

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

It was discovered that CIFS incorrectly handled authentication. When a user
had a CIFS share mounted that required authentication, a local user could
mount the same share without knowing the correct password. (CVE-2011-1585)

Andrea Righi discovered a race condition in the KSM memory merging support.
If KSM was being used, a local attacker could exploit this to crash the
system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2183)

Vasily Averin discovered that the NFS Lock Manager (NLM) incorrectly
handled unlock requests. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a
denial of service. (CVE-2011-2491)

Robert Swiecki discovered that mapping extensions were incorrectly handled.
A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a
denial of service. (CVE-2011-2496)

It was discovered that the wireless stack incorrectly verified SSID
lengths. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service
or gain root privileges. (CVE-2011-2517)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.10:
  linux-image-2.6.35-31-generic   2.6.35-31.62
  linux-image-2.6.35-31-generic-pae  2.6.35-31.62
  linux-image-2.6.35-31-omap      2.6.35-31.62
  linux-image-2.6.35-31-powerpc   2.6.35-31.62
  linux-image-2.6.35-31-powerpc-smp  2.6.35-31.62
  linux-image-2.6.35-31-powerpc64-smp  2.6.35-31.62
  linux-image-2.6.35-31-server    2.6.35-31.62
  linux-image-2.6.35-31-versatile  2.6.35-31.62
  linux-image-2.6.35-31-virtual   2.6.35-31.62

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

firefox vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04

Summary:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been fixed in Firefox.

Software Description:
- firefox: Mozilla Open Source web browser

Details:

Yosuke Hasegawa discovered that the Mozilla browser engine mishandled
invalid sequences in the Shift-JIS encoding. It may be possible to trigger
this crash without the use of debugging APIs, which might allow malicious
websites to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker could possibly use this
flaw this to steal data or inject malicious scripts into web content.
(CVE-2011-3648)

Marc Schoenefeld discovered that using Firebug to profile a JavaScript file
with many functions would cause Firefox to crash. An attacker might be able
to exploit this without using the debugging APIs, which could potentially
remotely crash the browser, resulting in a denial of service.
(CVE-2011-3650)

Jason Orendorff, Boris Zbarsky, Gregg Tavares, Mats Palmgren, Christian
Holler, Jesse Ruderman, Simona Marcu, Bob Clary, and William McCloskey
discovered multiple memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. An attacker might be able to use
these flaws to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
invoking Firefox or possibly crash the browser resulting in a denial of
service. (CVE-2011-3651)

It was discovered that Firefox could be caused to crash under certain
conditions, due to an unchecked allocation failure, resulting in a denial
of service. It might also be possible to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2011-3652)

Aki Helin discovered that Firefox does not properly handle links from SVG
mpath elements to non-SVG elements. An attacker could use this
vulnerability to crash Firefox, resulting in a denial of service, or
possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Firefox. (CVE-2011-3654)

It was discovered that an internal privilege check failed to respect the
NoWaiverWrappers introduced with Firefox 4. An attacker could possibly use
this to gain elevated privileges within the browser for web content.
(CVE-2011-3655)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  firefox                         8.0+build1-0ubuntu0.11.10.3

Ubuntu 11.04:
  firefox                         8.0+build1-0ubuntu0.11.04.3

After a standard system update you need to restart Firefox to make
all the necessary changes.

Subject: [USN-1269-1] Linux kernel (EC2) vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <4ECE4C60.3060802@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1269-1
November 21, 2011

linux-ec2 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-ec2: Linux kernel for EC2

Details:

Vasily Averin discovered that the NFS Lock Manager (NLM) incorrectly
handled unlock requests. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a
denial of service. (CVE-2011-2491)

Robert Swiecki discovered that mapping extensions were incorrectly handled.
A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a
denial of service. (CVE-2011-2496)

It was discovered that the wireless stack incorrectly verified SSID
lengths. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service
or gain root privileges. (CVE-2011-2517)

Ben Pfaff discovered that Classless Queuing Disciplines (qdiscs) were being
incorrectly handled. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the
system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2525)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-340-ec2      2.6.32-340.40

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

thunderbird vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10

Summary:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been fixed in Thunderbird.

Software Description:
- thunderbird: Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

Details:

Yosuke Hasegawa discovered that the Mozilla browser engine mishandled
invalid sequences in the Shift-JIS encoding. It may be possible to trigger
this crash without the use of debugging APIs, which might allow malicious
websites to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker could possibly use this
flaw this to steal data or inject malicious scripts into web content.
(CVE-2011-3648)

Marc Schoenefeld discovered that using Firebug to profile a JavaScript file
with many functions would cause Firefox to crash. An attacker might be able
to exploit this without using the debugging APIs, which could potentially
remotely crash Thunderbird, resulting in a denial of service.
(CVE-2011-3650)

Jason Orendorff, Boris Zbarsky, Gregg Tavares, Mats Palmgren, Christian
Holler, Jesse Ruderman, Simona Marcu, Bob Clary, and William McCloskey
discovered multiple memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Thunderbird and other Mozilla-based products. An attacker might be able to
use these flaws to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
invoking Thunderbird or possibly crash Thunderbird resulting in a denial of
service. (CVE-2011-3651)

It was discovered that Thunderbird could be caused to crash under certain
conditions, due to an unchecked allocation failure, resulting in a denial
of service. It might also be possible to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2011-3652)

Aki Helin discovered that Thunderbird does not properly handle links from
SVG mpath elements to non-SVG elements. An attacker could use this
vulnerability to crash Thunderbird, resulting in a denial of service, or
possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Thunderbird. (CVE-2011-3654)

It was discovered that an internal privilege check failed to respect the
NoWaiverWrappers introduced with Thunderbird 5. An attacker could possibly
use this to gain elevated privileges within Thunderbird for web content.
(CVE-2011-3655)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  thunderbird                     8.0+build1-0ubuntu0.11.10.1

After a standard system update you need to restart Thunderbird to make
all the necessary changes.

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

Summary:

Update Manager could be made to overwrite files as the administrator.

Software Description:
- update-manager: GNOME application that manages apt updates
- update-notifier: Daemon which notifies about package updates

Details:

David Black discovered that Update Manager incorrectly extracted the
downloaded upgrade tarball before verifying its GPG signature. If a remote
attacker were able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could
potentially be used to replace arbitrary files. (CVE-2011-3152)

David Black discovered that Update Manager created a temporary directory
in an insecure fashion. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to
read the XAUTHORITY file of the user performing the upgrade.
(CVE-2011-3154)

Subject: [USN-1285-1] Linux kernel vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <4ED5233F.10205@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1285-1
November 29, 2011

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.04

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Andrea Righi discovered a race condition in the KSM memory merging support.
If KSM was being used, a local attacker could exploit this to crash the
system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2183)

Vasily Averin discovered that the NFS Lock Manager (NLM) incorrectly
handled unlock requests. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a
denial of service. (CVE-2011-2491)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that taskstats did not enforce access
restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to read certain
information, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-2494)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that /proc/PID/io did not enforce access
restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to read certain
information, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-2495)

It was discovered that the wireless stack incorrectly verified SSID
lengths. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service
or gain root privileges. (CVE-2011-2517)

Christian Ohm discovered that the perf command looks for configuration
files in the current directory. If a privileged user were tricked into
running perf in a directory containing a malicious configuration file, an
attacker could run arbitrary commands and possibly gain privileges.
(CVE-2011-2905)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the Comedi driver did not correctly clear
memory. A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel stack memory,
leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-2909)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.04:
  linux-image-2.6.38-13-generic   2.6.38-13.52
  linux-image-2.6.38-13-generic-pae  2.6.38-13.52
  linux-image-2.6.38-13-omap      2.6.38-13.52
  linux-image-2.6.38-13-powerpc   2.6.38-13.52
  linux-image-2.6.38-13-powerpc-smp  2.6.38-13.52
  linux-image-2.6.38-13-powerpc64-smp  2.6.38-13.52
  linux-image-2.6.38-13-server    2.6.38-13.52
  linux-image-2.6.38-13-versatile  2.6.38-13.52
  linux-image-2.6.38-13-virtual   2.6.38-13.52

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.
