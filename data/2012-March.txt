Subject: [USN-1373-2] OpenJDK 6 (ARM) vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <20120301091301.GA4128@nxnw.org>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1373-2
March 01, 2012

openjdk-6b18 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Multiple vulnerabilities in OpenJDK 6 for the ARM architecture have
been fixed.

Software Description:
- openjdk-6b18: Open Source Java implementation

Details:

USN 1373-1 fixed vulnerabilities in OpenJDK 6 in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS,
Ubuntu 10.10 and Ubuntu 11.04 for all architectures except for ARM
(armel). This provides the corresponding OpenJDK 6 update for use
with the ARM (armel) architecture in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.10
and Ubuntu 11.04.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that the Java HttpServer class did not limit the
 number of headers read from a HTTP request. A remote attacker could
 cause a denial of service by sending special requests that trigger
 hash collisions predictably. (CVE-2011-5035)
 
 ATTENTION: this update changes previous Java HttpServer class behavior
 by limiting the number of request headers to 200. This may be increased
 by adjusting the sun.net.httpserver.maxReqHeaders property.
 
 It was discovered that the Java Sound component did not properly
 check buffer boundaries. A remote attacker could use this to cause
 a denial of service or view confidential data. (CVE-2011-3563)
 
 It was discovered that the Java2D implementation does not properly
 check graphics rendering objects before passing them to the native
 renderer. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of
 service or to bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2012-0497)
 
 It was discovered that an off-by-one error exists in the Java ZIP
 file processing code. An attacker could us this to cause a denial of
 service through a maliciously crafted ZIP file. (CVE-2012-0501)
 
 It was discovered that the Java AWT KeyboardFocusManager did not
 properly enforce keyboard focus security policy. A remote attacker
 could use this with an untrusted application or applet to grab keyboard
 focus and possibly expose confidential data. (CVE-2012-0502)
 
 It was discovered that the Java TimeZone class did not properly enforce
 security policy around setting the default time zone. A remote attacker
 could use this with an untrusted application or applet to set a new
 default time zone and bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2012-0503)
 
 It was discovered the Java ObjectStreamClass did not throw
 an accurately identifiable exception when a deserialization
 failure occurred. A remote attacker could use this with
 an untrusted application or applet to bypass Java sandbox
 restrictions. (CVE-2012-0505)
 
 It was discovered that the Java CORBA implementation did not properly
 protect repository identifiers on certain CORBA objects. A remote
 attacker could use this to corrupt object data. (CVE-2012-0506)
 
 It was discovered that the Java AtomicReferenceArray class
 implementation did not properly check if an array was of
 the expected Object[] type. A remote attacker could use this
 with a malicious application or applet to bypass Java sandbox
 restrictions. (CVE-2012-0507)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1385-1
March 06, 2012

apt vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04

Summary:

An attacker could trick APT into installing altered packages.

Software Description:
- apt: Advanced front-end for dpkg

Details:

Simon Ruderich discovered that APT incorrectly handled repositories that
use InRelease files. The default Ubuntu repositories do not use InRelease
files, so this issue only affected third-party repositories. If a remote
attacker were able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could
potentially be used to install altered packages.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  apt                             0.8.16~exp5ubuntu13.2

Ubuntu 11.04:
  apt                             0.8.13.2ubuntu4.4

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

linux-lts-backport-oneiric vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-lts-backport-oneiric: Linux kernel backport from Oneiric

Details:

A bug was discovered in the Linux kernel's calculation of OOM (Out of
memory) scores, that would result in the wrong process being killed. A user
could use this to kill the process with the highest OOM score, even if that
process belongs to another user or the system. (CVE-2011-4097)

Paolo Bonzini discovered a flaw in Linux's handling of the SG_IO ioctl
command. A local user, or user in a VM could exploit this flaw to bypass
restrictions and gain read/write access to all data on the affected block
device. (CVE-2011-4127)

A flaw was found in KVM's Programmable Interval Timer (PIT). When a virtual
interrupt control is not available a local user could use this to cause a
denial of service by starting a timer. (CVE-2011-4622)

A flaw was discovered in the XFS filesystem. If a local user mounts a
specially crafted XFS image it could potential execute arbitrary code on
the system. (CVE-2012-0038)

Andy Whitcroft discovered a that the Overlayfs filesystem was not doing the
extended permission checks needed by cgroups and Linux Security Modules
(LSMs). A local user could exploit this to by-pass security policy and
access files that should not be accessible. (CVE-2012-0055)

A flaw was found in the linux kernels IPv4 IGMP query processing. A remote
attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-0207)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.0.0-16-generic    3.0.0-16.29~lucid1
  linux-image-3.0.0-16-generic-pae  3.0.0-16.29~lucid1
  linux-image-3.0.0-16-server     3.0.0-16.29~lucid1
  linux-image-3.0.0-16-virtual    3.0.0-16.29~lucid1

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Subject: [USN-1388-1] Linux kernel (EC2) vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <4F565A06.7060801@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1388-1
March 06, 2012

linux-ec2 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-ec2: Linux kernel for EC2

Details:

Paolo Bonzini discovered a flaw in Linux's handling of the SG_IO ioctl
command. A local user, or user in a VM could exploit this flaw to bypass
restrictions and gain read/write access to all data on the affected block
device. (CVE-2011-4127)

A flaw was found in KVM's Programmable Interval Timer (PIT). When a virtual
interrupt control is not available a local user could use this to cause a
denial of service by starting a timer. (CVE-2011-4622)

A flaw was discovered in the XFS filesystem. If a local user mounts a
specially crafted XFS image it could potential execute arbitrary code on
the system. (CVE-2012-0038)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-343-ec2      2.6.32-343.45

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Message-ID: <1331220714.18248.1032.camel@veni>

Ubuntu announced its 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat) release almost 18 months
ago, on October 10, 2010 at 10:10:10 UTC.  As with the earlier releases,
Ubuntu committed to ongoing security and critical fixes for a period 
of 18 months. The support period is now nearing its end and Ubuntu 10.10
will reach end of life on Tuesday, April 10, 2012.  At that time, Ubuntu
Security Notices will no longer include information or updated packages
for Ubuntu 10.10.

The supported upgrade path from Ubuntu 10.10 is via Ubuntu 11.04.
Instructions and caveats for the upgrade may be found at
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NattyUpgrades.  Ubuntu 11.04
continues to be actively supported with security updates and
select high-impact bug fixes. All announcements of official security
updates for Ubuntu releases are sent to the ubuntu-security-announce
mailing list, information about which may be found at
https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-security-announce.

Since its launch in October 2004 Ubuntu has become one of the most
highly regarded Linux distributions with millions of users in homes,
schools, businesses and governments around the world. Ubuntu is Open
Source software, costs nothing to download, and users are free to
customise or alter their software in order to meet their needs.

Message-ID: <1331231624.2788.9.camel@mdlinux>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1395-1
March 08, 2012

python-pam vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

PyPAM could be made to crash or possibly run programs if it processed
a specially crafted password.

Software Description:
- python-pam: A Python interface to the PAM library

Details:

Markus Vervier discovered that PyPAM incorrectly handled passwords
containing NULL bytes. An attacker could exploit this to cause applications
using PyPAM to crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  python-pam                      0.4.2-12.2ubuntu2.11.10.1

Ubuntu 11.04:
  python-pam                      0.4.2-12.2ubuntu2.11.04.1

Ubuntu 10.10:
  python-pam                      0.4.2-12.1ubuntu1.10.10.1

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  python-pam                      0.4.2-12.1ubuntu1.10.04.1

After a standard system update you need to restart applications that use
PyPAM to make all the necessary changes.

Subject: [USN-1396-1] GNU C Library vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <20120309183030.GA22790@nxnw.org>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1396-1
March 09, 2012

eglibc, glibc vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

Summary:

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered and fixed in the GNU C Library.

Software Description:
- eglibc: Embedded GNU C Library: sources
- glibc: GNU C Library: Documentation

Details:

It was discovered that the GNU C Library did not properly handle
integer overflows in the timezone handling code. An attacker could use
this to possibly execute arbitrary code by convincing an application
to load a maliciously constructed tzfile. (CVE-2009-5029)

It was discovered that the GNU C Library did not properly handle
passwd.adjunct.byname map entries in the Network Information Service
(NIS) code in the name service caching daemon (nscd). An attacker
could use this to obtain the encrypted passwords of NIS accounts.
This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. (CVE-2010-0015)

Chris Evans reported that the GNU C Library did not properly
calculate the amount of memory to allocate in the fnmatch() code. An
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly
execute arbitrary code via a maliciously crafted UTF-8 string.
This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and Ubuntu
10.10. (CVE-2011-1071)

Tomas Hoger reported that an additional integer overflow was possible
in the GNU C Library fnmatch() code. An attacker could use this to
cause a denial of service via a maliciously crafted UTF-8 string. This
issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.10
and Ubuntu 11.04. (CVE-2011-1659)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the addmntent() function in the GNU C
Library did not report an error status for failed attempts to write to
the /etc/mtab file. This could allow an attacker to corrupt /etc/mtab,
possibly causing a denial of service or otherwise manipulate mount
options. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS,
Ubuntu 10.10 and Ubuntu 11.04. (CVE-2011-1089)

Harald van Dijk discovered that the locale program included with the
GNU C library did not properly quote its output. This could allow a
local attacker to possibly execute arbitrary code using a crafted
localization string that was evaluated in a shell script. This
issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and Ubuntu
10.10. (CVE-2011-1095)

It was discovered that the GNU C library loader expanded the
$ORIGIN dynamic string token when RPATH is composed entirely of this
token. This could allow an attacker to gain privilege via a setuid
program that had this RPATH value. (CVE-2011-1658)

It was discovered that the GNU C library implementation of memcpy
optimized for Supplemental Streaming SIMD Extensions 3 (SSSE3)
contained a possible integer overflow. An attacker could use this to
cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. This
issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. (CVE-2011-2702)

John Zimmerman discovered that the Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
implementation in the GNU C Library did not properly handle large
numbers of connections. This could allow a remote attacker to cause
a denial of service. (CVE-2011-4609)

It was discovered that the GNU C Library vfprintf() implementation
contained a possible integer overflow in the format string protection
code offered by FORTIFY_SOURCE. An attacker could use this flaw in
conjunction with a format string vulnerability to bypass the format
string protection and possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2012-0864)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:

firefox vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in Firefox.

Software Description:
- firefox: Mozilla Open Source web browser

Details:

Soroush Dalili discovered that Firefox did not adequately protect against
dropping JavaScript links onto a frame. A remote attacker could, through
cross-site scripting (XSS), exploit this to modify the contents or steal
confidential data. (CVE-2012-0455)

Atte Kettunen discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in Firefox's
handling of SVG animations. An attacker could potentially exploit this to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.
(CVE-2012-0457)

Atte Kettunen discovered an out of bounds read vulnerability in Firefox's
handling of SVG Filters. An attacker could potentially exploit this to make
data from the user's memory accessible to the page content. (CVE-2012-0456)

Mike Brooks discovered that using carriage return line feed (CRLF)
injection, one could introduce a new Content Security Policy (CSP) rule
which allows for cross-site scripting (XSS) on sites with a separate header
injection vulnerability. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a
user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker
could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data,
within the same domain. (CVE-2012-0451)

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the Home button accepted JavaScript links
to set the browser Home page. An attacker could use this vulnerability to
get the script URL loaded in the privileged about:sessionrestore context.
(CVE-2012-0458)

Daniel Glazman discovered that the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
implementation is vulnerable to crashing due to modification of a keyframe
followed by access to the cssText of the keyframe. If the user were tricked
into opening a specially crafted web page, an attacker could exploit this
to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute
code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-0459)

Matt Brubeck discovered that Firefox did not properly restrict access to
the window.fullScreen object. If the user were tricked into opening a
specially crafted web page, an attacker could potentially use this
vulnerability to spoof the user interface. (CVE-2012-0460)

Bob Clary, Christian Holler, Jesse Ruderman, Nils, Michael Bebenita,
Dindog, David Anderson, Jeff Walden, Vincenzo Iozzo, and Willem Pinckaers
discovered memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were tricked
into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit these to
cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute
code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-0461,
CVE-2012-0462, CVE-2012-0464)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  firefox                         11.0+build1-0ubuntu0.11.10.1

Ubuntu 11.04:
  firefox                         11.0+build1-0ubuntu0.11.04.1

Ubuntu 10.10:
  firefox                         11.0+build1-0ubuntu0.10.10.2

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  firefox                         11.0+build1-0ubuntu0.10.04.2

After a standard system update you need to restart Firefox to make
all the necessary changes.

xulrunner-1.9.2 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in Firefox.

Software Description:
- xulrunner-1.9.2: Mozilla Gecko runtime environment

Details:

It was discovered that a flaw in the Mozilla SVG implementation could
result in an out-of-bounds memory access if SVG elements were removed
during a DOMAttrModified event handler. If the user were tricked into
opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit this to cause a
denial of service via application crash. (CVE-2011-3658)

Atte Kettunen discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the Gecko
Rendering Engine's handling of SVG animations. An attacker could
potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
the user invoking the Xulrunner based application. (CVE-2012-0457)
 
Atte Kettunen discovered an out of bounds read vulnerability in the Gecko
Rendering Engine's handling of SVG Filters. An attacker could potentially
exploit this to make data from the user's memory accessible to the page
content. (CVE-2012-0456)

Soroush Dalili discovered that the Gecko Rendering Engine did not
adequately protect against dropping JavaScript links onto a frame. A remote
attacker could, through cross-site scripting (XSS), exploit this to modify
the contents of the frame or steal confidential data. (CVE-2012-0455)

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the Home button accepted JavaScript links
to set the browser Home page. An attacker could use this vulnerability to
get the script URL loaded in the privileged about:sessionrestore context.
(CVE-2012-0458)

Bob Clary, Vincenzo Iozzo, and Willem Pinckaers discovered memory safety
issues affecting Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially
crafted page, an attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service
via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of
the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-0461, CVE-2012-0464)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.10:
  xulrunner-1.9.2                 1.9.2.28+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.10.1

Message-ID: <4F718823.5080900@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1404-1
March 27, 2012

linux-ti-omap4 vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10

Summary:

The system could be made to deny services if it received specially crafted
local area network traffic.

Software Description:
- linux-ti-omap4: Linux kernel for OMAP4

Details:

Somnath Kotur discovered an error in the Linux kernel's VLAN (virtual lan)
and be2net drivers. An attacker on the local network could exploit this
flaw to cause a denial of service.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  linux-image-3.0.0-1208-omap4    3.0.0-1208.18

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1197-7
March 27, 2012

ca-certificates-java vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

A certificate authority mis-issued fraudulent certificates.

Software Description:
- ca-certificates-java: Common CA certificates (JKS keystore)

Details:

USN-1197-5 addressed an issue in ca-certificates pertaining to the Dutch
Certificate Authority DigiNotar mis-issuing fraudulent certificates.
This update provides the corresponding update for ca-certificates-java.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that Dutch Certificate Authority DigiNotar had
 mis-issued multiple fraudulent certificates. These certificates could allow
 an attacker to perform a "man in the middle" (MITM) attack which would make
 the user believe their connection is secure, but is actually being
 monitored.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  ca-certificates-java            20110912ubuntu3.1

Ubuntu 11.04:
  ca-certificates-java            20100412ubuntu0.11.04.1

Ubuntu 10.10:
  ca-certificates-java            20100412ubuntu0.10.10.1

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  ca-certificates-java            20100406ubuntu1.1

After a standard system update you need to restart any application using
ca-certificates-java to make all the necessary changes.

Subject: [USN-1412-1] Linux kernel vulnerability
Message-ID: <1333035678.22890.5.camel@mdlinux>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1412-1
March 29, 2012

linux vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Somnath Kotur discovered an error in the Linux kernel's VLAN (virtual lan)
and be2net drivers. An attacker on the local network could exploit this
flaw to cause a denial of service.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  linux-image-3.0.0-17-generic    3.0.0-17.30
  linux-image-3.0.0-17-generic-pae  3.0.0-17.30
  linux-image-3.0.0-17-omap       3.0.0-17.30
  linux-image-3.0.0-17-powerpc    3.0.0-17.30
  linux-image-3.0.0-17-powerpc-smp  3.0.0-17.30
  linux-image-3.0.0-17-powerpc64-smp  3.0.0-17.30
  linux-image-3.0.0-17-server     3.0.0-17.30
  linux-image-3.0.0-17-virtual    3.0.0-17.30

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

the length of server names. An authenticated attacker could issue requests
using long server names to exhaust the storage resources containing the Nova
API log file.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  python-nova                     2011.3-0ubuntu6.5

Subject: [USN-1197-8] ca-certificates-java regression
Message-ID: <1333041406.22890.14.camel@mdlinux>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1197-8
March 29, 2012

ca-certificates-java regression
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10

Summary:

USN-1197-7 introduced a regression in ca-certificates-java.

Software Description:
- ca-certificates-java: Common CA certificates (JKS keystore)

Details:

USN-1197-7 fixed a vulnerability in ca-certificates-java. The new package
broke upgrades from Ubuntu 11.04 to Ubuntu 11.10. This update fixes the
problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that Dutch Certificate Authority DigiNotar had
 mis-issued multiple fraudulent certificates. These certificates could allow
 an attacker to perform a "man in the middle" (MITM) attack which would make
 the user believe their connection is secure, but is actually being
 monitored.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  ca-certificates-java            20110912ubuntu3.2

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
