Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2064-1
January 03, 2014

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Stephan Mueller reported an error in the Linux kernel's ansi cprng random
number generator. This flaw makes it easier for a local attacker to break
cryptographic protections. (CVE-2013-4345)

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's IP Virtual Server (IP_VS)
support. A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could exploit this
flaw to gain additional administrative privileges. (CVE-2013-4588)

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's
debugfs filesystem. An administrative local user could exploit this flaw to
cause a denial of service (OOPS). (CVE-2013-6378)

Nico Golde reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's userspace IO (uio) driver.
A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption) or possibly gain privileges. (CVE-2013-6763)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-55-386       2.6.32-55.117
  linux-image-2.6.32-55-generic   2.6.32-55.117
  linux-image-2.6.32-55-generic-pae  2.6.32-55.117
  linux-image-2.6.32-55-ia64      2.6.32-55.117
  linux-image-2.6.32-55-lpia      2.6.32-55.117
  linux-image-2.6.32-55-powerpc   2.6.32-55.117
  linux-image-2.6.32-55-powerpc-smp  2.6.32-55.117
  linux-image-2.6.32-55-powerpc64-smp  2.6.32-55.117
  linux-image-2.6.32-55-preempt   2.6.32-55.117
  linux-image-2.6.32-55-server    2.6.32-55.117
  linux-image-2.6.32-55-sparc64   2.6.32-55.117
  linux-image-2.6.32-55-sparc64-smp  2.6.32-55.117
  linux-image-2.6.32-55-versatile  2.6.32-55.117
  linux-image-2.6.32-55-virtual   2.6.32-55.117

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.11.0-15-generic   3.11.0-15.23~precise1
  linux-image-3.11.0-15-generic-lpae  3.11.0-15.23~precise1

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Subject: [USN-2076-1] Linux kernel (OMAP4) vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <52C69D13.1080500@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2076-1
January 03, 2014

linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 13.10

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-ti-omap4: Linux kernel for OMAP4

Details:

Dave Jones and Vince Weaver reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's per event
subsystem that allows normal users to enable function tracing. An
unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially
sensitive information from the kernel. (CVE-2013-2930)

Stephan Mueller reported an error in the Linux kernel's ansi cprng random
number generator. This flaw makes it easier for a local attacker to break
cryptographic protections. (CVE-2013-4345)

Multiple integer overflow flaws were discovered in the Alchemy LCD frame-
buffer drivers in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could
exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2013-4511)

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a buffer overflow in the Ozmo
Devices USB over WiFi devices. A local user could exploit this flaw to
cause a denial of service or possibly unspecified impact. (CVE-2013-4513)

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's
driver for Agere Systems HERMES II Wireless PC Cards. A local user with the
CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of
service or possibly gain adminstrative priviliges. (CVE-2013-4514)

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's
driver for Beceem WIMAX chipset based devices. An unprivileged local user
could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.
(CVE-2013-4515)

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's compat ioctls for Adaptec
AACRAID scsi raid devices. An unprivileged local user could send
administrative commands to these devices potentially compromising the data
stored on the device. (CVE-2013-6383)

Nico Golde reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's userspace IO (uio) driver.
A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption) or possibly gain privileges. (CVE-2013-6763)

Evan Huus reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's radiotap header
parsing. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (buffer over-
read) via a specially crafted header. (CVE-2013-7027)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 13.10:
  linux-image-3.5.0-237-omap4     3.5.0-237.53

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

27th.  At that time, Ubuntu Security Notices will no longer include
information or updated packages for Ubuntu 13.04.

The supported upgrade path from Ubuntu 13.04 is via Ubuntu 13.10.
Instructions and caveats for the upgrade may be found at:

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SaucyUpgrades

Ubuntu 13.10 continues to be actively supported with security updates
and select high-impact bug fixes.  Announcements of security updates
for Ubuntu releases are sent to the ubuntu-security-announce mailing
list, information about which may be found at:

https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-security-announce

Since its launch in October 2004 Ubuntu has become one of the most
highly regarded Linux distributions with millions of users in homes,
schools, businesses and governments around the world. Ubuntu is Open
Source software, costs nothing to download, and users are free to
customise or alter their software in order to meet their needs.

On behalf of the Ubuntu Release Team,

Adam Conrad

Summary:

libXfont could be made to crash or run programs as an administrator if it
opened a specially crafted font file.

Software Description:
- libxfont: X11 font rasterisation library

Details:

It was discovered that libXfont incorrectly handled certain malformed BDF
fonts. An attacker could use a specially crafted font file to cause

Summary:

Graphviz could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened
a specially crafted file.

Software Description:
- graphviz: rich set of graph drawing tools

Details:

It was discovered that Graphviz incorrectly handled memory in the yyerror
function. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted dot file,
an attacker could cause Graphviz to crash, or possibly execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2014-0978, CVE-2014-1235)

It was discovered that Graphviz incorrectly handled memory in the chkNum
function. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted dot file,
an attacker could cause Graphviz to crash, or possibly execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2014-1236)

Subject: Ubuntu 13.04 (Raring Ringtail) End of Life reached on January 27 2014
Message-ID: <20140128092747.GN15976@0c3.net>

This is a follow-up to the End of Life warning sent last month to
confirm that as of today (Jan 27, 2014), Ubuntu 13.04 is no longer
supported.  No more package updates will be accepted to 13.04, and
it will be archived to old-releases.ubuntu.com in the coming weeks.

The original End of Life warning follows, with upgrade instructions:

Ubuntu announced its 13.04 (Raring Ringtail) release almost 9 months
ago, on April 25, 2013.  This was the first release with our new 9
month support cycle and, as such, the support period is now nearing
its end and Ubuntu 13.04 will reach end of life on Monday, January
27th.  At that time, Ubuntu Security Notices will no longer include
information or updated packages for Ubuntu 13.04.

The supported upgrade path from Ubuntu 13.04 is via Ubuntu 13.10.
Instructions and caveats for the upgrade may be found at:

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SaucyUpgrades

Ubuntu 13.10 continues to be actively supported with security updates
and select high-impact bug fixes.  Announcements of security updates
for Ubuntu releases are sent to the ubuntu-security-announce mailing
list, information about which may be found at:

https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-security-announce

Since its launch in October 2004 Ubuntu has become one of the most
highly regarded Linux distributions with millions of users in homes,
schools, businesses and governments around the world. Ubuntu is Open
Source software, costs nothing to download, and users are free to
customise or alter their software in order to meet their needs.

On behalf of the Ubuntu Release Team,

Adam Conrad
