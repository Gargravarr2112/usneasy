==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1415-1
April 03, 2012

linux-mvl-dove vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.10

Summary:

The system could be made to crash under certain conditions.

Software Description:
- linux-mvl-dove: Linux kernel for DOVE

Details:

Louis Rilling discovered a flaw in Linux kernel's clone command when
CLONE_IO is specified. An unprivileged local user could exploit this to
cause a denial of service.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.10:
  linux-image-2.6.32-423-dove     2.6.32-423.42

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

thunderbird regressions
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10

Summary:

USN-1400-3 introduced regressions in Thunderbird.

Software Description:
- thunderbird: Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

Details:

USN-1400-3 fixed vulnerabilities in Thunderbird. The new Thunderbird
version caused a regression in IMAP connections and mail filtering. This
update fixes the problem.

Original advisory details:

 Soroush Dalili discovered that Firefox did not adequately protect against
 dropping JavaScript links onto a frame. A remote attacker could, through
 cross-site scripting (XSS), exploit this to modify the contents or steal
 confidential data. (CVE-2012-0455)
 
 Atte Kettunen discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in Firefox's
 handling of SVG animations. An attacker could potentially exploit this to
 execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.
 (CVE-2012-0457)
 
 Atte Kettunen discovered an out of bounds read vulnerability in Firefox's
 handling of SVG Filters. An attacker could potentially exploit this to make
 data from the user's memory accessible to the page content. (CVE-2012-0456)
 
 Mike Brooks discovered that using carriage return line feed (CRLF)
 injection, one could introduce a new Content Security Policy (CSP) rule
 which allows for cross-site scripting (XSS) on sites with a separate header
 injection vulnerability. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a
 user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker
 could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data,
 within the same domain. (CVE-2012-0451)
 
 Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the Home button accepted JavaScript links
 to set the browser Home page. An attacker could use this vulnerability to
 get the script URL loaded in the privileged about:sessionrestore context.
 (CVE-2012-0458)
 
 Daniel Glazman discovered that the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
 implementation is vulnerable to crashing due to modification of a keyframe
 followed by access to the cssText of the keyframe. If the user were tricked
 into opening a specially crafted web page, an attacker could exploit this
 to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute
 code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-0459)
 
 Matt Brubeck discovered that Firefox did not properly restrict access to
 the window.fullScreen object. If the user were tricked into opening a
 specially crafted web page, an attacker could potentially use this
 vulnerability to spoof the user interface. (CVE-2012-0460)
 
 Bob Clary, Christian Holler, Jesse Ruderman, Michael Bebenita, David
 Anderson, Jeff Walden, Vincenzo Iozzo, and Willem Pinckaers discovered
 memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were tricked into
 opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit these to
 cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute
 code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-0461,
 CVE-2012-0462, CVE-2012-0464)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  thunderbird                     11.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.11.10.1

After a standard system update you need to restart Thunderbird to make
all the necessary changes.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

gsettings-desktop-schemas regression
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.04

Summary:

Firefox's ability to use system proxy settings regressed.

Software Description:
- gsettings-desktop-schemas: GSettings desktop-wide schemas

Details:

USN-1400-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. Firefox 11 started using
GSettings to access the system proxy settings. If there is a GSettings
proxy settings schema, Firefox will consume it. The GSettings proxy
settings schema that was shipped by default was unused by other
applications and broke Firefox's ability to use system proxy settings. This
update removes the unused schema. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Soroush Dalili discovered that Firefox did not adequately protect against
 dropping JavaScript links onto a frame. A remote attacker could, through
 cross-site scripting (XSS), exploit this to modify the contents or steal
 confidential data. (CVE-2012-0455)
 
 Atte Kettunen discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in Firefox's
 handling of SVG animations. An attacker could potentially exploit this to
 execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.
 (CVE-2012-0457)
 
 Atte Kettunen discovered an out of bounds read vulnerability in Firefox's
 handling of SVG Filters. An attacker could potentially exploit this to make
 data from the user's memory accessible to the page content. (CVE-2012-0456)
 
 Mike Brooks discovered that using carriage return line feed (CRLF)
 injection, one could introduce a new Content Security Policy (CSP) rule
 which allows for cross-site scripting (XSS) on sites with a separate header
 injection vulnerability. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a
 user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker
 could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data,
 within the same domain. (CVE-2012-0451)
 
 Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the Home button accepted JavaScript links
 to set the browser Home page. An attacker could use this vulnerability to
 get the script URL loaded in the privileged about:sessionrestore context.
 (CVE-2012-0458)
 
 Daniel Glazman discovered that the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
 implementation is vulnerable to crashing due to modification of a keyframe
 followed by access to the cssText of the keyframe. If the user were tricked
 into opening a specially crafted web page, an attacker could exploit this
 to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute
 code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-0459)
 
 Matt Brubeck discovered that Firefox did not properly restrict access to
 the window.fullScreen object. If the user were tricked into opening a
 specially crafted web page, an attacker could potentially use this
 vulnerability to spoof the user interface. (CVE-2012-0460)
 
 Bob Clary, Christian Holler, Jesse Ruderman, Michael Bebenita, David
 Anderson, Jeff Walden, Vincenzo Iozzo, and Willem Pinckaers discovered
 memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were tricked into
 opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit these to
 cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute
 code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-0461,
 CVE-2012-0462, CVE-2012-0464)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.04:
  gsettings-desktop-schemas       3.0.0-0ubuntu1.1

After a standard system update you need to restart Firefox to make
all the necessary changes.

Subject: [USN-1428-1] OpenSSL vulnerability
Message-ID: <1335300911.4832.4.camel@localhost>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1428-1
April 24, 2012

openssl vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

Summary:

An application using OpenSSL could be made to crash or run programs if it
opened a specially crafted file.

Software Description:
- openssl: Secure Socket Layer (SSL) cryptographic library and tools

Details:

It was discovered that the fix for CVE-2012-2110 was incomplete for OpenSSL
0.9.8. A remote attacker could trigger this flaw in services that used SSL
to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with
application privileges. Ubuntu 11.10 was not affected by this issue.
(CVE-2012-2131)

The original upstream fix for CVE-2012-2110 would cause BUF_MEM_grow_clean()
to sometimes return the wrong error condition. This update fixes the
problem.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  libssl1.0.0                     1.0.0e-2ubuntu4.5

Ubuntu 11.04:
  libssl0.9.8                     0.9.8o-5ubuntu1.5

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  libssl0.9.8                     0.9.8k-7ubuntu8.11

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS:
  libssl0.9.8                     0.9.8g-4ubuntu3.18

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

Subject: [USN-1429-1] Jetty vulnerability
Message-ID: <1335472691.563.8.camel@mdlinux>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1429-1
April 26, 2012

jetty vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Jetty could be made to hang or crash if it received specially crafted
network traffic.

Software Description:
- jetty: Java servlet engine and webserver

Details:

It was discovered that Jetty computed hash values for form parameters
without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably.
This could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service by
sending many crafted parameters.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.04:
  libjetty-java                   6.1.24-6ubuntu0.11.04.1

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  libjetty-java                   6.1.22-1ubuntu1.1

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

firefox vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in Firefox.

Software Description:
- firefox: Mozilla Open Source web browser

Details:

Bob Clary, Christian Holler, Brian Hackett, Bobby Holley, Gary Kwong,
Hilary Hall, Honza Bambas, Jesse Ruderman, Julian Seward, and Olli Pettay
discovered memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were tricked
into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit these to
cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute
code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-0467,
CVE-2012-0468)

Aki Helin discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in XPConnect. An
attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-0469)

Atte Kettunen discovered that invalid frees cause heap corruption in
gfxImageSurface. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious Scalable
Vector Graphics (SVG) image file, an attacker could exploit these to cause
a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with
the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-0470)

Anne van Kesteren discovered a potential cross-site scripting (XSS)
vulnerability via multibyte content processing errors. With cross-site
scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially
crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents,
or steal confidential data, within the same domain. (CVE-2012-0471)

Matias Juntunen discovered a vulnerability in Firefox's WebGL
implementation that potentially allows the reading of illegal video memory.
An attacker could possibly exploit this to cause a denial of service via
application crash. (CVE-2012-0473)

Jordi Chancel, Eddy Bordi, and Chris McGowen discovered that Firefox
allowed the address bar to display a different website than the one the
user was visiting. This could potentially leave the user vulnerable to
cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. With cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted
page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal
confidential data, within the same domain. (CVE-2012-0474)

Simone Fabiano discovered that Firefox did not always send correct origin
headers when connecting to an IPv6 websites. An attacker could potentially
use this to bypass intended access controls. (CVE-2012-0475)

Masato Kinugawa discovered that cross-site scripting (XSS) injection is
possible during the decoding of ISO-2022-KR and ISO-2022-CN character sets.
With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into
viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to
modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain.
(CVE-2012-0477)

It was discovered that certain images rendered using WebGL could cause
Firefox to crash. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted
page, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via
application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the
user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-0478)

Mateusz Jurczyk discovered an off-by-one error in the OpenType Sanitizer.
If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker
could exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or
potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.
(CVE-2011-3062)

Daniel Divricean discovered a defect in the error handling of JavaScript
errors can potentially leak the file names and location of JavaScript files
on a server. This could potentially lead to inadvertent information
disclosure and a vector for further attacks. (CVE-2011-1187)

Jeroen van der Gun discovered a vulnerability in the way Firefox handled
RSS and Atom feeds. Invalid RSS or ATOM content loaded over HTTPS caused
the location bar to be updated with the address of this content, while the
main window still displays the previously loaded content. An attacker could
potentially exploit this vulnerability to conduct phishing attacks.
(CVE-2012-0479)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  firefox                         12.0+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1

Ubuntu 11.10:
