ghostscript vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

Summary:

Ghostscript could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a specially crafted file.

Software Description:
- ghostscript: The GPL Ghostscript PostScript/PDF interpreter

Details:

It was discovered that Ghostscript did not correctly handle memory
allocation when parsing certain malformed JPEG-2000 images. If a user or
automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted image, an
attacker could cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary
code with user privileges. (CVE-2008-3520)

It was discovered that Ghostscript did not correctly handle certain
formatting operations when parsing JPEG-2000 images. If a user or automated
system were tricked into opening a specially crafted image, an attacker
could cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code with
user privileges. (CVE-2008-3522)

It was discovered that Ghostscript incorrectly handled certain malformed
TrueType fonts. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a
document containing a specially crafted font, an attacker could cause a
denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges.
This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. (CVE-2009-3743)

It was discovered that Ghostscript incorrectly handled certain malformed
Type 2 fonts. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a
document containing a specially crafted font, an attacker could cause a
denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges.
This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. (CVE-2010-4054)

Jonathan Foote discovered that Ghostscript incorrectly handled certain
malformed JPEG-2000 image files. If a user or automated system were tricked
into opening a specially crafted JPEG-2000 image file, an attacker could
cause Ghostscript to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code with user
privileges. (CVE-2011-4516, CVE-2011-4517)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.10:
  libgs8                          8.71.dfsg.2-0ubuntu7.1

Message-ID: <4F05A009.2020802@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1318-1
January 05, 2012

linux-fsl-imx51 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-fsl-imx51: Linux kernel for IMX51

Details:

Peter Huewe discovered an information leak in the handling of reading
security-related TPM data. A local, unprivileged user could read the
results of a previous TPM command. (CVE-2011-1162)

Clement Lecigne discovered a bug in the HFS filesystem. A local attacker
could exploit this to cause a kernel oops. (CVE-2011-2203)

A flaw was found in how the Linux kernel handles user-defined key types. An
unprivileged local user could exploit this to crash the system.
(CVE-2011-4110)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.31-612-imx51    2.6.31-612.32

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

firefox vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in Firefox.

Software Description:
- firefox: Mozilla Open Source web browser

Details:

Alexandre Poirot, Chris Blizzard, Kyle Huey, Scoobidiver, Christian Holler,
David Baron, Gary Kwong, Jim Blandy, Bob Clary, Jesse Ruderman, Marcia
Knous, and Rober Longson discovered several memory safety issues which
could possibly be exploited to crash Firefox or execute arbitrary code as
the user that invoked Firefox. (CVE-2011-3660)

Aki Helin discovered a crash in the YARR regular expression library that
could be triggered by javascript in web content. (CVE-2011-3661)

It was discovered that a flaw in the Mozilla SVG implementation could
result in an out-of-bounds memory access if SVG elements were removed
during a DOMAttrModified event handler. An attacker could potentially
exploit this vulnerability to crash Firefox. (CVE-2011-3658)

Mario Heiderich discovered it was possible to use SVG animation accessKey
events to detect key strokes even when JavaScript was disabled. A malicious
web page could potentially exploit this to trick a user into interacting
with a prompt thinking it came from the browser in a context where the user
believed scripting was disabled. (CVE-2011-3663)

It was discovered that it was possible to crash Firefox when scaling an OGG
<video> element to extreme sizes. (CVE-2011-3665)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  firefox                         9.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.11.10.2

Ubuntu 11.04:

==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Clement Lecigne discovered a bug in the HFS filesystem. A local attacker
could exploit this to cause a kernel oops. (CVE-2011-2203)

A bug was discovered in the XFS filesystem's handling of pathnames. A local
attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of
service, or gain root privileges. (CVE-2011-4077)

Nick Bowler discovered the kernel GHASH message digest algorithm
incorrectly handled error conditions. A local attacker could exploit this
to cause a kernel oops. (CVE-2011-4081)

A flaw was found in how the Linux kernel handles user-defined key types. An
unprivileged local user could exploit this to crash the system.
(CVE-2011-4110)

A flaw was found in the Journaling Block Device (JBD). A local attacker
able to mount ext3 or ext4 file systems could exploit this to crash the
system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-4132)

Clement Lecigne discovered a bug in the HFS file system bounds checking.
When a malformed HFS file system is mounted a local user could crash the

The upstream Mozilla Firefox web browser has moved to a rapid release
cycle. New Firefox versions are being released every six weeks and
contain new features and security enhancements. Until now, Ubuntu 10.04
LTS and Ubuntu 10.10 have been getting 3.6 point releases of Firefox. As
such, users have not been benefiting from new features, support for new
web technologies, security enhancements, and performance improvements.
Firefox 3.6 will be reaching its end of life soon, so we need to migrate
users to rapid release so that they will continue to receive security
updates in a timely fashion.

* What is changing? *

Starting on January 17, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and Ubuntu 10.10 users will be
migrated to the latest Firefox version, and will track the rapid
releases going forward, as is currently done in newer releases of
Ubuntu. This will enable users to get the numerous improvements offered
by new Firefox versions.

* What is the impact of this migration? *

Add-ons that were previously in the Ubuntu archive, such as flashblock
or webdeveloper, will be automatically migrated to reside in your user
profile so that they may be updated through the regular update process
using addons.mozilla.org. This is necessary to ensure that you
automatically get a working version of these addons, if one is
available, when a new version of Firefox is released.

As Firefox will be updated to a new version every 6 weeks, the browsing
experience might change slightly with each update.

* What do I need to do? *

These updates will be pushed automatically through the regular update
process once testing has been completed. No action is required on your
part.

Users who access specialized web sites, such as intranets or corporate
portals, need to make sure they are compatible with the latest Firefox
releases before the migration occurs.

* Can I help with testing? *

If you would like to assist with testing, you can enable the proposed
repository on non-production Ubuntu 10.04 LTS or Ubuntu 10.10 systems [1].

* For more information *

Please see the following wiki page for information on the migration: [2]

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1324-1
January 11, 2012

linux-ec2 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Two security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-ec2: Linux kernel for EC2

Details:

Clement Lecigne discovered a bug in the HFS filesystem. A local attacker
could exploit this to cause a kernel oops. (CVE-2011-2203)

A flaw was found in how the Linux kernel handles user-defined key types. An
unprivileged local user could exploit this to crash the system.
(CVE-2011-4110)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-342-ec2      2.6.32-342.43

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

libav vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04

Summary:

Libav could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened a
specially crafted file.

Software Description:
- libav: Multimedia player, server, encoder and transcoder

Details:

Steve Manzuik discovered that Libav incorrectly handled certain malformed
Matroska files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted Matroska
file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or
possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
the program. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04. (CVE-2011-3504)

Phillip Langlois discovered that Libav incorrectly handled certain
malformed QDM2 streams. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted QDM2
stream file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application
crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
invoking the program. (CVE-2011-4351)

Phillip Langlois discovered that Libav incorrectly handled certain
malformed VP3 streams. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted file,
an attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or
possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
the program. (CVE-2011-4352)

Phillip Langlois discovered that Libav incorrectly handled certain
malformed VP5 and VP6 streams. If a user were tricked into opening a
crafted file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application
crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
invoking the program. (CVE-2011-4353)

It was discovered that Libav incorrectly handled certain malformed VMD
files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted VMD file, an attacker
could cause a denial of service via application crash, or possibly execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.
(CVE-2011-4364)

Phillip Langlois discovered that Libav incorrectly handled certain
malformed SVQ1 streams. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted SVQ1
stream file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application
crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
invoking the program. (CVE-2011-4579)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  libavcodec53                    4:0.7.3-0ubuntu0.11.10.1

Subject: Java packages in Partner archive to be removed on 2012-02-16
Message-ID: <1326819389.3234.20.camel@mdlinux>

The Canonical partner archive currently contains Oracle's Sun Java JDK
packages (sun-java6) for Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.10 and Ubuntu 11.04.

As of August 24th 2011, we no longer have permission to redistribute new
Java packages as Oracle has retired the ?Operating System Distributor
License for Java? [1][2].

In accordance with our previous announcement [3][4], we will be removing
the Sun JDK packages from the partner archive on February 16th 2012.
In order to prevent unexpected failures, we will not be pushing out empty
packages before removing them from the archive.

The Sun JDK packages will remain installed on current systems with no
further security updates. On new systems, it will no longer be possible to
install the packages from the partner archive. Sun Java 6 Users are
encouraged to migrate to an alternative solution as specified in the
wiki [3].

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, and thank you for your
understanding.

when parsing certain XML documents. This could allow a remote attacker to
cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2821, CVE-2011-2834)

It was discovered that libxml2 did not properly detect end of file when
parsing certain XML documents. An attacker could exploit this to crash
applications linked against libxml2. (CVE-2011-3905)

It was discovered that libxml2 did not properly decode entity references
with long names. If a user or application linked against libxml2 were
tricked into opening a specially crafted XML file, an attacker could cause
the application to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2011-3919)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-lts-backport-oneiric: Linux kernel backport from Oneiric

Details:

Clement Lecigne discovered a bug in the HFS filesystem. A local attacker
could exploit this to cause a kernel oops. (CVE-2011-2203)

A bug was discovered in the XFS filesystem's handling of pathnames. A local
attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of
service, or gain root privileges. (CVE-2011-4077)

A flaw was found in how the Linux kernel handles user-defined key types. An
unprivileged local user could exploit this to crash the system.
(CVE-2011-4110)

A flaw was found in the Journaling Block Device (JBD). A local attacker
able to mount ext3 or ext4 file systems could exploit this to crash the
system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-4132)

Clement Lecigne discovered a bug in the HFS file system bounds checking.
When a malformed HFS file system is mounted a local user could crash the
system or gain root privileges. (CVE-2011-4330)

Chen Haogang discovered an integer overflow that could result in memory
corruption. A local unprivileged user could use this to crash the system.
(CVE-2012-0044)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.0.0-15-generic    3.0.0-15.25~lucid1
  linux-image-3.0.0-15-generic-pae  3.0.0-15.25~lucid1
  linux-image-3.0.0-15-server     3.0.0-15.25~lucid1
  linux-image-3.0.0-15-virtual    3.0.0-15.25~lucid1

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Subject: [USN-1339-1] QEMU vulnerability
Message-ID: <1327360859.18994.55.camel@localhost>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1339-1
January 23, 2012

qemu-kvm vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

A remote attacker could cause QEMU to crash.

Software Description:
- qemu-kvm: Machine emulator and virtualizer

Details:

Nicolae Mogoreanu discovered that QEMU did not properly verify legacy mode
packets in the e1000 network driver. A remote attacker could exploit this
to cause a denial of service or possibly execute code with the privileges
of the user invoking the program.

When using QEMU with libvirt or virtualization management software based on
libvirt such as Eucalyptus and OpenStack, QEMU guests are individually
isolated by an AppArmor profile by default in Ubuntu.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  qemu-kvm                        0.14.1+noroms-0ubuntu6.2

Ubuntu 11.04:
  qemu-kvm                        0.14.0+noroms-0ubuntu4.5

Ubuntu 10.10:
  qemu-kvm                        0.12.5+noroms-0ubuntu7.11
  qemu-kvm-extras                 0.12.5+noroms-0ubuntu7.11
  qemu-kvm-extras-static          0.12.5+noroms-0ubuntu7.11

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  qemu-kvm                        0.12.3+noroms-0ubuntu9.17
  qemu-kvm-extras                 0.12.3+noroms-0ubuntu9.17
  qemu-kvm-extras-static          0.12.3+noroms-0ubuntu9.17

After a standard system update you need to restart running virtual machines
which use the e1000 network driver to make all the necessary changes.

thunderbird vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird.

Software Description:
- thunderbird: Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

Details:

Alexandre Poirot, Chris Blizzard, Kyle Huey, Scoobidiver, Christian Holler,
David Baron, Gary Kwong, Jim Blandy, Bob Clary, Jesse Ruderman, Marcia
Knous, and Rober Longson discovered several memory safety issues which
could possibly be exploited to crash Thunderbird or execute arbitrary code
as the user that invoked Thunderbird. (CVE-2011-3660)

Aki Helin discovered a crash in the YARR regular expression library that
could be triggered by javascript in web content. (CVE-2011-3661)

It was discovered that a flaw in the Mozilla SVG implementation could
result in an out-of-bounds memory access if SVG elements were removed
during a DOMAttrModified event handler. An attacker could potentially
exploit this vulnerability to crash Thunderbird. (CVE-2011-3658)

Mario Heiderich discovered it was possible to use SVG animation accessKey
events to detect key strokes even when JavaScript was disabled. A malicious
web page could potentially exploit this to trick a user into interacting
with a prompt thinking it came from Thunderbird in a context where the user
believed scripting was disabled. (CVE-2011-3663)

It was discovered that it was possible to crash Thunderbird when scaling an
OGG <video> element to extreme sizes. (CVE-2011-3665)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  thunderbird                     9.0+build2-0ubuntu0.11.10.1

After a standard system update you need to restart Thunderbird to make
all the necessary changes.

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1344-1
January 24, 2012

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Clement Lecigne discovered a bug in the HFS filesystem. A local attacker
could exploit this to cause a kernel oops. (CVE-2011-2203)

A flaw was found in how the Linux kernel handles user-defined key types. An
unprivileged local user could exploit this to crash the system.
(CVE-2011-4110)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-38-386       2.6.32-38.83
  linux-image-2.6.32-38-generic   2.6.32-38.83
  linux-image-2.6.32-38-generic-pae  2.6.32-38.83
  linux-image-2.6.32-38-ia64      2.6.32-38.83
  linux-image-2.6.32-38-lpia      2.6.32-38.83
  linux-image-2.6.32-38-powerpc   2.6.32-38.83
  linux-image-2.6.32-38-powerpc-smp  2.6.32-38.83
  linux-image-2.6.32-38-powerpc64-smp  2.6.32-38.83
  linux-image-2.6.32-38-preempt   2.6.32-38.83
  linux-image-2.6.32-38-server    2.6.32-38.83
  linux-image-2.6.32-38-sparc64   2.6.32-38.83
  linux-image-2.6.32-38-sparc64-smp  2.6.32-38.83
  linux-image-2.6.32-38-versatile  2.6.32-38.83
  linux-image-2.6.32-38-virtual   2.6.32-38.83

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

openjdk-6, openjdk-6b18 regression
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

USN-1263-1 caused a regression when using OpenJDK 6's SSL/TLS
implementation.

Software Description:
- openjdk-6: Open Source Java implementation
- openjdk-6b18: Open Source Java implementation

Details:

USN-1263-1 fixed vulnerabilities in OpenJDK 6. The upstream patch for
the chosen plaintext attack on the block-wise AES encryption algorithm
(CVE-2011-3389) introduced a regression that caused TLS/SSL connections
to fail when using certain algorithms. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Deepak Bhole discovered a flaw in the Same Origin Policy (SOP)
 implementation in the IcedTea web browser plugin. This could allow a
 remote attacker to open connections to certain hosts that should
 not be permitted. (CVE-2011-3377)
 
 Juliano Rizzo and Thai Duong discovered that the block-wise AES
 encryption algorithm block-wise as used in TLS/SSL was vulnerable to
 a chosen-plaintext attack. This could allow a remote attacker to view
 confidential data. (CVE-2011-3389)
 
 It was discovered that a type confusion flaw existed in the in
 the Internet Inter-Orb Protocol (IIOP) deserialization code. A
 remote attacker could use this to cause an untrusted application
 or applet to execute arbitrary code by deserializing malicious
 input. (CVE-2011-3521)
 
 It was discovered that the Java scripting engine did not perform
 SecurityManager checks. This could allow a remote attacker to cause
 an untrusted application or applet to execute arbitrary code with
 the full privileges of the JVM. (CVE-2011-3544)
 
 It was discovered that the InputStream class used a global buffer to
 store input bytes skipped. An attacker could possibly use this to gain
 access to sensitive information. (CVE-2011-3547)
 
 It was discovered that a vulnerability existed in the AWTKeyStroke
 class. A remote attacker could cause an untrusted application or applet
 to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2011-3548)
 
 It was discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed
 in the TransformHelper class in the Java2D implementation. A remote
 attacker could use this cause a denial of service via an application
 or applet crash or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2011-3551)
 
 It was discovered that the default number of available UDP sockets for
 applications running under SecurityManager restrictions was set too
 high. A remote attacker could use this with a malicious application or
 applet exhaust the number of available UDP sockets to cause a denial
 of service for other applets or applications running within the same
 JVM. (CVE-2011-3552)
 
 It was discovered that Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS) could
 incorrectly expose a stack trace. A remote attacker could potentially
 use this to gain access to sensitive information. (CVE-2011-3553)
 
 It was discovered that the unpacker for pack200 JAR files did not
 sufficiently check for errors. An attacker could cause a denial of
 service or possibly execute arbitrary code through a specially crafted
 pack200 JAR file. (CVE-2011-3554)
 
 It was discovered that the RMI registration implementation did not
 properly restrict privileges of remotely executed code. A remote
 attacker could use this to execute code with elevated privileges.
 (CVE-2011-3556, CVE-2011-3557)
 
 It was discovered that the HotSpot VM could be made to crash, allowing
 an attacker to cause a denial of service or possibly leak sensitive
 information. (CVE-2011-3558)
 
 It was discovered that the HttpsURLConnection class did not
 properly perform SecurityManager checks in certain situations. This
 could allow a remote attacker to bypass restrictions on HTTPS
 connections. (CVE-2011-3560)

- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Evince could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened a
specially crafted file.

Software Description:
- evince: Document viewer

Details:

It was discovered that Evince did not properly parse AFM font files when
processing DVI files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially
crafted DVI file, an attacker could cause Evince to crash or potentially
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the
program.

In the default installation, attackers would be isolated by the Evince
AppArmor profile.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.04:
  libevdocument3                  2.32.0-0ubuntu12.4

Ubuntu 10.10:
  libevdocument3                  2.32.0-0ubuntu1.2

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  libevdocument2                  2.30.3-0ubuntu1.3

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
