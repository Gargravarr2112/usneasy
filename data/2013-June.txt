==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1851-1
June 03, 2013

python-keystoneclient vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 13.04

Summary:

The python client library for Keystone did not properly verify expired PKI
tokens.

Software Description:
- python-keystoneclient: Client library for OpenStack Identity API

Details:

Eoghan Glynn and Alex Meade discovered that python-keystoneclient did not
properly perform expiry checks for the PKI tokens used in Keystone. If
Keystone were setup to use PKI tokens (the default in Ubuntu 13.04), a
previously authenticated user could continue to use a PKI token for longer
than intended.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 13.04:
  python-keystoneclient           1:0.2.3-0ubuntu2.2

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

keystone vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 13.04
- Ubuntu 12.10

Summary:

Keystone did not always properly verify expired PKI tokens or properly
authenticate users.

Software Description:
- keystone: OpenStack identity service

Details:

Eoghan Glynn and Alex Meade discovered that Keystone did not properly
perform expiry checks for the PKI tokens used in Keystone. If Keystone were
setup to use PKI tokens, a previously authenticated user could continue to
use a PKI token for longer than intended. This issue only affected Ubuntu
12.10 which does not use PKI tokens by default. (CVE-2013-2104)

Jose Castro Leon discovered that Keystone did not properly authenticate
users when using the LDAP backend. An attacker could obtain valid tokens
and impersonate other users by supplying an empty password. By default,
Ubuntu does not use the LDAP backend. (CVE-2013-2157)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 13.04:
  python-keystone                 1:2013.1.1-0ubuntu2.1

Ubuntu 12.10:
  python-keystone                 2012.2.4-0ubuntu3.1

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

handling for the netrom address family. A local user could exploit this
flaw to obtain sensitive information from the kernel's stack memory.
(CVE-2013-3232)

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's Rose X.25 protocol
layer. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially
sensitive information from the kernel's stack memory. (CVE-2013-3234)

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's TIPC (Transparent
Inter Process Communication) protocol implementation. A local user could
exploit this flaw to examine potentially sensitive information from the
kernel's stack memory. (CVE-2013-3235)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-48-386       2.6.32-48.110
  linux-image-2.6.32-48-generic   2.6.32-48.110

  linux-image-2.6.32-48-lpia      2.6.32-48.110
  linux-image-2.6.32-48-powerpc   2.6.32-48.110
  linux-image-2.6.32-48-powerpc-smp  2.6.32-48.110
  linux-image-2.6.32-48-powerpc64-smp  2.6.32-48.110
  linux-image-2.6.32-48-preempt   2.6.32-48.110
  linux-image-2.6.32-48-server    2.6.32-48.110

  linux-image-2.6.32-48-virtual   2.6.32-48.110

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's Rose X.25 protocol
layer. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially
sensitive information from the kernel's stack memory. (CVE-2013-3234)

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's TIPC (Transparent
Inter Process Communication) protocol implementation. A local user could
exploit this flaw to examine potentially sensitive information from the
kernel's stack memory. (CVE-2013-3235)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.2.0-48-generic    3.2.0-48.74
  linux-image-3.2.0-48-generic-pae  3.2.0-48.74
  linux-image-3.2.0-48-highbank   3.2.0-48.74
  linux-image-3.2.0-48-omap       3.2.0-48.74
  linux-image-3.2.0-48-powerpc-smp  3.2.0-48.74
  linux-image-3.2.0-48-powerpc64-smp  3.2.0-48.74
  linux-image-3.2.0-48-virtual    3.2.0-48.74

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Subject: [USN-1883-1] Linux kernel (OMAP4) vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <51BAC6D1.4080800@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1883-1
June 14, 2013

linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 13.04

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-ti-omap4: Linux kernel for OMAP4

Details:

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel's iSCSI subsystem. A remote
unauthenticated attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of
service (system crash) or potentially gain administrative privileges.
(CVE-2013-2850)

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's crypto API. A
local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially sensitive
information from the kernel's stack memory. (CVE-2013-3076)

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's rcvmsg path for
ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode). A local user could exploit this flaw to
examine potentially sensitive information from the kernel's stack memory.
(CVE-2013-3222)

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's recvmsg path for
ax25 address family. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine
potentially sensitive information from the kernel's stack memory.
(CVE-2013-3223)

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's recvmsg path for
the bluetooth address family. A local user could exploit this flaw to
examine potentially sensitive information from the kernel's stack memory.
(CVE-2013-3224)

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's bluetooth rfcomm
protocol support. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine
potentially sensitive information from the kernel's stack memory.
(CVE-2013-3225)

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's Rose X.25 protocol
layer. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially
sensitive information from the kernel's stack memory. (CVE-2013-3234)

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's TIPC (Transparent
Inter Process Communication) protocol implementation. A local user could
exploit this flaw to examine potentially sensitive information from the
kernel's stack memory. (CVE-2013-3235)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 13.04:
  linux-image-3.5.0-226-omap4     3.5.0-226.39

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

swift vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 13.04
- Ubuntu 12.10
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Multiple security issues were fixed in OpenStack Swift.

Software Description:
- swift: OpenStack distributed virtual object store

Details:

Sebastian Krahmer discovered that Swift used the loads function in the
pickle Python module when it was configured to use memcached. A remote
attacker on the same network as memcached could exploit this to execute
arbitrary code. This update adds a new memcache_serialization_support
option to support secure json serialization. For details on this new
option, please see /usr/share/doc/swift-proxy/memcache.conf-sample. This
issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. (CVE-2012-4406)

Alex Gaynor discovered that Swift did not safely generate XML. An
attacker could potentially craft an account name to generate arbitrary XML
responses to trigger vulnerabilties in software parsing Swift's XML.
(CVE-2013-2161)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 13.04:
  python-swift                    1.8.0-0ubuntu1.2

Ubuntu 12.10:
  python-swift                    1.7.4-0ubuntu2.2

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  python-swift                    1.4.8-0ubuntu2.2

After a standard system update you need to restart Swift to make all the
necessary changes.

firefox vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 13.04
- Ubuntu 12.10
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

Software Description:
- firefox: Mozilla Open Source web browser

Details:

Multiple memory safety issues were discovered in Firefox. If the user were
tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly
exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or
potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Firefox. (CVE-2013-1682, CVE-2013-1683)

Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free bugs. If the user were
tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly
exploit these to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-1684, CVE-2013-1685, CVE-2013-1686)

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that user defined code within the XBL scope of
an element could be made to bypass System Only Wrappers (SOW). An attacker
could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2013-1687)

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the profiler user interface incorrectly
handled data from the profiler. If the user examined profiler output
on a specially crafted page, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.
(CVE-2013-1688)

A crash was discovered when reloading a page that contained content using
the onreadystatechange event. An attacker could potentially exploit this
to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox
(CVE-2013-1690)

Johnathan Kuskos discovered that Firefox sent data in the body of

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird.

Software Description:
- thunderbird: Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

Details:

Multiple memory safety issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If the user
were tricked into opening a specially crafted message with scripting
enabled, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of
service via application crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-1682)

Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free bugs. If the user were
tricked into opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled,
an attacker could possibly exploit these to execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-1684,
CVE-2013-1685, CVE-2013-1686)

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that user defined code within the XBL scope of
an element could be made to bypass System Only Wrappers (SOW). If a user
had scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-1687)

A crash was discovered when reloading a page that contained content using
the onreadystatechange event. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker
could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-1690)

XMLHttpRequest HEAD requests. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker
could exploit this to conduct Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
(CVE-2013-1692)

Paul Stone discovered a timing flaw in the processing of SVG images with
filters. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could exploit this
to view sensitive information. (CVE-2013-1693)

Boris Zbarsky discovered a flaw in PreserveWrapper. If a user had
scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause
a denial of service via application crash, or execute code with the
privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-1694)

It was discovered that XrayWrappers could be bypassed to call
content-defined methods in certain circumstances. If a user had scripting
enabled, an attacker could exploit this to cause undefined behaviour.
(CVE-2013-1697)
