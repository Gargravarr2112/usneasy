linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Mathias Krause discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's UDF
file system implementation. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine
some of the kernel's heap memory. (CVE-2012-6548)

Mathias Krause discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's ISO
9660 CDROM file system driver. A local user could exploit this flaw to
examine some of the kernel's heap memory. (CVE-2012-6549)

An integer overflow was discovered in the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM)
subsystem for the i915 video driver in the Linux kernel. A local user could
exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash) or potentially
escalate privileges. (CVE-2013-0913)

Andrew Honig discovered a flaw in guest OS time updates in the Linux
kernel's KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine). A privileged guest user could
exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash host system) or
potential escalate privilege to the host kernel level. (CVE-2013-1796)

Andrew Honig discovered a use after free error in guest OS time updates in
the Linux kernel;s KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine). A privileged guest
user could exploit this flaw to escalate privilege to the host kernel
level. (CVE-2013-1797)

Andrew Honig reported a flaw in the way KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)
emulated the IOAPIC. A privileged guest user could exploit this flaw to
read host memory or cause a denial of service (crash the host).
(CVE-2013-1798)

A format-string bug was discovered in the Linux kernel's ext3 filesystem
driver. A local user could exploit this flaw to possibly escalate
privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-1848)

A buffer overflow was discovered in the Linux Kernel's USB subsystem for
devices reporting the cdc-wdm class. A specially crafted USB device when
plugged-in could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2013-1860)

An information leak in the Linux kernel's dcb netlink interface was
discovered. A local user could obtain sensitive information by examining
kernel stack memory. (CVE-2013-2634)

A kernel stack information leak was discovered in the RTNETLINK component
of the Linux kernel. A local user could read sensitive information from the
kernel stack. (CVE-2013-2635)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.2.0-41-generic    3.2.0-41.66
  linux-image-3.2.0-41-generic-pae  3.2.0-41.66
  linux-image-3.2.0-41-highbank   3.2.0-41.66
  linux-image-3.2.0-41-omap       3.2.0-41.66
  linux-image-3.2.0-41-powerpc-smp  3.2.0-41.66
  linux-image-3.2.0-41-powerpc64-smp  3.2.0-41.66
  linux-image-3.2.0-41-virtual    3.2.0-41.66

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Subject: [USN-1823-1] Thunderbird vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <5192B383.2060502@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1823-1
May 14, 2013

thunderbird vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 13.04
- Ubuntu 12.10
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird.

Software Description:
- thunderbird: Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

Details:

Multiple memory safety issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If the user
were tricked into opening a specially crafted message with scripting
enabled, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of
service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the
privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-0801,
CVE-2013-1669)

Cody Crews discovered that some constructors could be used to bypass
restrictions enforced by their Chrome Object Wrapper (COW). If a user had
scripting enabled, an attacker could exploit this to conduct cross-site
scripting (XSS) attacks. (CVE-2013-1670)

A use-after-free was discovered when resizing video content whilst it is
playing. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially
exploit this to execute code with the privileges of the user invoking
Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-1674)

It was discovered that some DOMSVGZoomEvent functions could be used
without being properly initialized, which could lead to information
leakage. (CVE-2013-1675)

Abhishek Arya discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If
the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted message, an
attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via
application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of
the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-1676, CVE-2013-1677,
CVE-2013-1678, CVE-2013-1679, CVE-2013-1680, CVE-2013-1681)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 13.04:
  thunderbird                     17.0.6+build1-0ubuntu0.13.04.1

Ubuntu 12.10:
  thunderbird                     17.0.6+build1-0ubuntu0.12.10.1

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  thunderbird                     17.0.6+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1

After a standard system update you need to restart Thunderbird to make
all the necessary changes.

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Mathias Krause discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's ISO
9660 CDROM file system driver. A local user could exploit this flaw to
examine some of the kernel's heap memory. (CVE-2012-6549)

Mathias Krause discovered a flaw in xfrm_user in the Linux kernel. A local
attacker with NET_ADMIN capability could potentially exploit this flaw to
escalate privileges. (CVE-2013-1826)

A buffer overflow was discovered in the Linux Kernel's USB subsystem for
devices reporting the cdc-wdm class. A specially crafted USB device when
plugged-in could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2013-1860)

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's /dev/dvb device. A
local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from the
kernel's stack memory. (CVE-2013-1928)

An information leak in the Linux kernel's dcb netlink interface was
discovered. A local user could obtain sensitive information by examining
kernel stack memory. (CVE-2013-2634)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-47-386       2.6.32-47.109
  linux-image-2.6.32-47-generic   2.6.32-47.109

  linux-image-2.6.32-47-lpia      2.6.32-47.109
  linux-image-2.6.32-47-powerpc   2.6.32-47.109
  linux-image-2.6.32-47-powerpc-smp  2.6.32-47.109
  linux-image-2.6.32-47-powerpc64-smp  2.6.32-47.109
  linux-image-2.6.32-47-preempt   2.6.32-47.109
  linux-image-2.6.32-47-server    2.6.32-47.109
  linux-image-2.6.32-47-sparc64   2.6.32-47.109
  linux-image-2.6.32-47-sparc64-smp  2.6.32-47.109
  linux-image-2.6.32-47-versatile  2.6.32-47.109
  linux-image-2.6.32-47-virtual   2.6.32-47.109

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1831-1
May 16, 2013

nova vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 13.04
- Ubuntu 12.10
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Nova could be made to crash the system if instances used a specially
crafted image.

Software Description:
- nova: OpenStack Compute cloud infrastructure

Details:

Loganathan Parthipan discovered that Nova did not verify the size of QCOW2
instance storage. An authenticated attacker could exploit this to cause a
denial of service by creating an image with a large virtual size with
little data, then filling the virtual disk.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 13.04:
  python-nova                     1:2013.1-0ubuntu2.1

Ubuntu 12.10:
  python-nova                     2012.2.3-0ubuntu2.1

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  python-nova
2012.1.3+stable-20130423-e52e6912-0ubuntu1.1

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1832-1
May 21, 2013

tiff vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 13.04
- Ubuntu 12.10
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

LibTIFF could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened a
specially crafted file.

Software Description:
- tiff: Tag Image File Format (TIFF) library

Details:

Emmanuel Bouillon discovered that LibTIFF incorrectly handled certain
malformed images when using the tiff2pdf tool. If a user or automated
system were tricked into opening a specially crafted TIFF image, a remote
attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial of service, or
possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 13.04:
  libtiff5                        4.0.2-4ubuntu2.1

Ubuntu 12.10:
  libtiff5                        4.0.2-1ubuntu2.2

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  libtiff4                        3.9.5-2ubuntu1.5

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  libtiff4                        3.9.2-2ubuntu0.13

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1833-1
May 24, 2013

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Andy Lutomirski discover an error in the Linux kernel's credential handling
on unix sockets. A local user could exploit this flaw to gain
administrative privileges. (CVE-2013-1979)

A buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in the Broadcom tg3 ethernet
driver for the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause
a denial of service (crash the system) or potentially escalate privileges
on the system. (CVE-2013-1929)

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's ftrace subsystem interface. A
local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system
crash). (CVE-2013-3301)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.2.0-44-generic    3.2.0-44.69
  linux-image-3.2.0-44-generic-pae  3.2.0-44.69
  linux-image-3.2.0-44-highbank   3.2.0-44.69
  linux-image-3.2.0-44-omap       3.2.0-44.69
  linux-image-3.2.0-44-powerpc-smp  3.2.0-44.69
  linux-image-3.2.0-44-powerpc64-smp  3.2.0-44.69
  linux-image-3.2.0-44-virtual    3.2.0-44.69

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1831-2
May 29, 2013

nova regression
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.10

Summary:

USN-1831-1 introduced a regression in OpenStack Nova.

Software Description:
- nova: OpenStack Compute cloud infrastructure

Details:

USN-1831-1 fixed a vulnerability in OpenStack Nova. The upstream fix
introduced a regression where instances using uncached QCOW2 images would
fail to start. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Loganathan Parthipan discovered that Nova did not verify the size of QCOW2
 instance storage. An authenticated attacker could exploit this to cause a
 denial of service by creating an image with a large virtual size with
 little data, then filling the virtual disk.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.10:
  python-nova                     2012.2.3-0ubuntu2.2

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

kde4libs vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 13.04
- Ubuntu 12.10
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

KDE-Libs could be made to expose web credentials.

Software Description:
- kde4libs: KDE 4 core applications and libraries

Details:

It was discovered that KIO would sometimes display web authentication
credentials under certain error conditions. If a user were tricked into
opening a specially crafted web page, an attacker could potentially exploit
this to expose confidential information.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 13.04:
  libkio5                         4:4.10.2-0ubuntu2.2

Ubuntu 12.10:
  libkio5                         4:4.9.5-0ubuntu0.2

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  libkio5                         4:4.8.5-0ubuntu0.2

After a standard system update you need to restart any applications that
use KIO from KDE-Libs, such as Konqueror, to make all the necessary changes.

Details:

It was discovered that GnuTLS incorrectly handled certain padding bytes. A
remote attacker could use this flaw to cause an application using GnuTLS to
crash, leading to a denial of service.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 13.04:
  libgnutls26                     2.12.23-1ubuntu1.1

Message-ID: <51A7192D.2050008@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1838-1

linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 13.04

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-ti-omap4: Linux kernel for OMAP4

Details:

An flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's perf_events interface. A local
user could exploit this flaw to escalate privileges on the system.
(CVE-2013-2094)

A buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in the Broadcom tg3 ethernet
driver for the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause
a denial of service (crash the system) or potentially escalate privileges
on the system. (CVE-2013-1929)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 13.04:
  linux-image-3.5.0-225-omap4     3.5.0-225.36

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.
