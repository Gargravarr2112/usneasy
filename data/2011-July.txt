After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.10:
  linux-image-2.6.32-417-dove     2.6.32-417.34

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1168-1
July 15, 2011

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Multiple kernel flaws have been fixed.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Timo Warns discovered that the LDM disk partition handling code did not
correctly handle certain values. By inserting a specially crafted disk
device, a local attacker could exploit this to gain root privileges.
(CVE-2011-1017)

Neil Horman discovered that NFSv4 did not correctly handle certain orders
of operation with ACL data. A remote attacker with access to an NFSv4 mount
could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.
(CVE-2011-1090)

Timo Warns discovered that OSF partition parsing routines did not correctly
clear memory. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a
specially crafted block device to read kernel memory, leading to a loss of
privacy. (CVE-2011-1163)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that MPT devices did not correctly validate
certain values in ioctl calls. If these drivers were loaded, a local
attacker could exploit this to read arbitrary kernel memory, leading to a
loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-1494, CVE-2011-1495)

Tavis Ormandy discovered that the pidmap function did not correctly handle
large requests. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system,
leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-1593)

Oliver Hartkopp and Dave Jones discovered that the CAN network driver did
not correctly validate certain socket structures. If this driver was
loaded, a local attacker could crash the system, leading to a denial of
service. (CVE-2011-1598, CVE-2011-1748)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the AGP driver did not check certain ioctl
values. A local attacker with access to the video subsystem could exploit
this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service, or possibly gain
root privileges. (CVE-2011-1745, CVE-2011-2022)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the AGP driver did not check the size of
certain memory allocations. A local attacker with access to the video
subsystem could exploit this to run the system out of memory, leading to a
denial of service. (CVE-2011-1746, CVE-2011-1747)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the DCCP stack did not correctly handle
certain packet structures. A remote attacker could exploit this to crash
the system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-1770)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-33-386       2.6.32-33.70
  linux-image-2.6.32-33-generic   2.6.32-33.70
  linux-image-2.6.32-33-generic-pae  2.6.32-33.70
  linux-image-2.6.32-33-ia64      2.6.32-33.70
  linux-image-2.6.32-33-lpia      2.6.32-33.70
  linux-image-2.6.32-33-powerpc   2.6.32-33.70
  linux-image-2.6.32-33-powerpc-smp  2.6.32-33.70
  linux-image-2.6.32-33-powerpc64-smp  2.6.32-33.70
  linux-image-2.6.32-33-preempt   2.6.32-33.70
  linux-image-2.6.32-33-server    2.6.32-33.70
  linux-image-2.6.32-33-sparc64   2.6.32-33.70
  linux-image-2.6.32-33-sparc64-smp  2.6.32-33.70
  linux-image-2.6.32-33-versatile  2.6.32-33.70
  linux-image-2.6.32-33-virtual   2.6.32-33.70

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

An attacker could discover a user's name or confuse a user into granting
unintended access to files.

Software Description:
- icedtea-web: An implementation of the Java Network Launching Protocol (JNLP)
- openjdk-6: Open Source Java implementation
- openjdk-6b18: Open Source Java implementation

Details:

Omair Majid discovered that an unsigned Web Start application
or applet could determine the path to the cache directory used
to store downloaded class and jar files by querying class loader
properties. This could allow a remote attacker to discover a user's
name and home directory path. (CVE-2011-2513)

Omair Majid discovered that an unsigned Web Start application could
manipulate the content of the security warning dialog message to show
different file names in prompts. This could allow a remote attacker
to confuse a user into granting access to a different file than they
believe they are granting access to. This issue only affected Ubuntu
11.04. (CVE-2011-2514)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.04:
  icedtea-netx                    1.1.1-0ubuntu1~11.04.1
  icedtea-plugin                  1.1.1-0ubuntu1~11.04.1

Ubuntu 10.10:
  icedtea6-plugin                 6b20-1.9.9-0ubuntu1~10.10.2

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  icedtea6-plugin                 6b20-1.9.9-0ubuntu1~10.04.2

After a standard system update you need to restart any Java applications
or applets to make all the necessary changes.
