Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1938-1
September 05, 2013

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 13.04

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Vasily Kulikov discovered a flaw in the Linux Kernel's perf tool that
allows for privilege escalation. A local could exploit this flaw to run
commands as root when using the perf tool. (CVE-2013-1060)

A flaw was discovered in the Xen subsystem of the Linux kernel when it
provides a guest OS read-only access to disks that support TRIM or SCSI
UNMAP. A privileged user in the guest OS could exploit this flaw to
destroy data on the disk. (CVE-2013-2140)

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel when an IPv6 socket is used to
connect to an IPv4 destination. A unprivileged local user could exploit
this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2013-2232)

An information leak was discovered in the IPSec key_socket implementation
in the Linux kernel. An local user could exploit this flaw to examine
potentially sensitive information in kernel memory. (CVE-2013-2234)

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in the setsockopt UDP_CORK option
in the Linux kernel's IPv6 stack. A local user could exploit this flaw to
cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2013-4162)

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in the IPv6 subsystem of the Linux
kernel when the IPV6_MTU setsockopt option has been specified in
combination with the UDP_CORK option. A local user could exploit this flaw
to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2013-4163)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 13.04:
  linux-image-3.8.0-30-generic    3.8.0-30.44

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1944-1
September 06, 2013

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.10

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

A denial of service flaw was discovered in the Btrfs file system in the
Linux kernel. A local user could cause a denial of service by creating a
large number of files with names that have the same CRC32 hash value.
(CVE-2012-5374)

A denial of service flaw was discovered in the Btrfs file system in the
Linux kernel. A local user could cause a denial of service (prevent file
creation) for a victim, by creating a file with a specific CRC32C hash
value in a directory important to the victim. (CVE-2012-5375)

Vasily Kulikov discovered a flaw in the Linux Kernel's perf tool that
allows for privilege escalation. A local user could exploit this flaw to
run commands as root when using the perf tool. (CVE-2013-1060)

A flaw was discovered in the Xen subsystem of the Linux kernel when it
provides read-only access to a disk that supports TRIM or SCSI UNMAP to a
guest OS. A privileged user in the guest OS could exploit this flaw to
destroy data on the disk, even though the guest OS should not be able to
write to the disk. (CVE-2013-2140)

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel when an IPv6 socket is used to
connect to an IPv4 destination. An unprivileged local user could exploit
this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2013-2232)

An information leak was discovered in the IPSec key_socket implementation
in the Linux kernel. An local user could exploit this flaw to examine
potentially sensitive information in kernel memory. (CVE-2013-2234)

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in setsockopt UDP_CORK option in the
Linux kernel's IPv6 stack. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a
denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2013-4162)

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in the IPv6 subsystem of the Linux
kernel when the IPV6_MTU setsockopt option has been specified in
combination with the UDP_CORK option. A local user could exploit this flaw
to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2013-4163)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.10:
  linux-image-3.5.0-40-generic    3.5.0-40.62
  linux-image-3.5.0-40-highbank   3.5.0-40.62
  linux-image-3.5.0-40-omap       3.5.0-40.62
  linux-image-3.5.0-40-powerpc-smp  3.5.0-40.62
  linux-image-3.5.0-40-powerpc64-smp  3.5.0-40.62

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Message-ID: <522DC88D.8000807@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1948-1
September 09, 2013

python-httplib2 vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 13.04
- Ubuntu 12.10
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Fraudulent security certificates could allow sensitive information to
be exposed when accessing the Internet.

Software Description:
- python-httplib2: comprehensive HTTP client library written for Python

Details:

It was discovered that httplib2 only validated SSL certificates on the
first request to a connection, and didn't report validation failures on
subsequent requests. If a remote attacker were able to perform a
man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could possibly be exploited in certain
scenarios to alter or compromise confidential information in applications
that used the httplib2 library.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 13.04:
  python-httplib2                 0.7.7-1ubuntu0.1

Ubuntu 12.10:
  python-httplib2                 0.7.4-2ubuntu0.1

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  python-httplib2                 0.7.2-1ubuntu2.1

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  python-httplib2                 0.7.2-1ubuntu2~0.10.04.2

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

Software Description:
- imagemagick: Image manipulation programs and library

Details:

It was discovered that ImageMagick incorrectly handled decoding GIF image
comments. If a user or automated system using ImageMagick were tricked into
opening a specially crafted GIF image, an attacker could exploit this to
cause a denial of service or possibly execute code with the privileges of
the user invoking the program.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 13.04:
  libmagick++5                    8:6.7.7.10-5ubuntu2.1

Subject: [USN-1952-1] Thunderbird vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <5239D882.2080509@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1952-1
September 18, 2013

thunderbird vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 13.04
- Ubuntu 12.10
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird.

Software Description:
- thunderbird: Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

Details:

Multiple memory safety issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user
were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting
enabled, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of
service via application crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-1718)

Atte Kettunen discovered a flaw in the HTML5 Tree Builder when interacting
with template elements. If a user had scripting enabled, in some
circumstances an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.
(CVE-2013-1720)

Alex Chapman discovered an integer overflow vulnerability in the ANGLE
library. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially
exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-1721)

Abhishek Arya discovered a use-after-free in the Animation Manager. If
a user had scripting enabled, an attacked could potentially exploit this
to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-1722)

Scott Bell discovered a use-after-free when using a select element. If
a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this
to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-1724)

It was discovered that the scope of new Javascript objects could be
accessed before their compartment is initialized. If a user had scripting
enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute code with
the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-1725)

Dan Gohman discovered that some variables and data were used in IonMonkey,
without being initialized, which could lead to information leakage.
(CVE-2013-1728)

Sachin Shinde discovered a crash when moving some XBL-backed nodes
in to a document created by document.open(). If a user had scripting
enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial
of service. (CVE-2013-1730)

Aki Helin discovered a buffer overflow when combining lists, floats and
multiple columns. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges
of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-1732)

Two memory corruption bugs when scrolling were discovered. If a user had
scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a
denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-1735,
CVE-2013-1736)

Boris Zbarsky discovered that user-defined getters on DOM proxies would
use the expando object as "this". If a user had scripting enabled, an
attacker could potentially exploit this by tricking add-on code in to
making incorrect security sensitive decisions based on malicious values.
(CVE-2013-1737)

A use-after-free bug was discovered in Thunderbird. If a user had
scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.
(CVE-2013-1738)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 13.04:
  thunderbird                     1:24.0+build1-0ubuntu0.13.04.1

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1969-1
September 27, 2013

linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-ti-omap4: Linux kernel for OMAP4

Details:

Vince Weaver discovered a flaw in the perf subsystem of the Linux kernel on
ARM platforms. A local user could exploit this flaw to gain privileges or
cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2013-4254)

A failure to validate block numbers was discovered in the Linux kernel's
implementation of the XFS filesystem. A local user can cause a denial of
service (system crash) if they can mount, or cause to be mounted a
corrupted or special crafted XFS filesystem. (CVE-2013-1819)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  linux-image-3.2.0-1438-omap4    3.2.0-1438.57

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Message-ID: <524584BA.1060307@canonical.com>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1972-1
September 27, 2013

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 12.10

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Vince Weaver discovered a flaw in the perf subsystem of the Linux kernel on
ARM platforms. A local user could exploit this flaw to gain privileges or
cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2013-4254)

A failure to validate block numbers was discovered in the Linux kernel's
implementation of the XFS filesystem. A local user can cause a denial of
service (system crash) if they can mount, or cause to be mounted a
corrupted or special crafted XFS filesystem. (CVE-2013-1819)

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's IPSec key_socket
when using the notify_policy interface. A local user could exploit this
flaw to examine potentially sensitive information in kernel memory.
(CVE-2013-2237)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 12.10:
  linux-image-3.5.0-41-generic    3.5.0-41.64
  linux-image-3.5.0-41-highbank   3.5.0-41.64
  linux-image-3.5.0-41-omap       3.5.0-41.64
  linux-image-3.5.0-41-powerpc-smp  3.5.0-41.64
  linux-image-3.5.0-41-powerpc64-smp  3.5.0-41.64

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

- Ubuntu 12.10
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Summary:

txt2man could be made to overwrite files.

Software Description:
- txt2man: Converts flat ASCII text to man page format

Details:

Patrick J Cherry discovered that txt2man contained leftover debugging code
that incorrectly created a temporary file. A local attacker could possibly
use this issue to overwrite arbitrary files. In the default Ubuntu
installation, this should be prevented by the Yama link restrictions.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 13.04:
  txt2man                         1.5.5-4ubuntu0.13.04.1

Ubuntu 12.10:
  txt2man                         1.5.5-4ubuntu0.12.10.1

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  txt2man                         1.5.5-4ubuntu0.12.04.1

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
