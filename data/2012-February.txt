usbmuxd vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04

Summary:

usbmuxd could be made to crash or run programs if it received specially
crafted input.

Software Description:
- usbmuxd: USB multiplexor daemon for iPhone and iPod Touch devices

Details:

It was discovered that usbmuxd did not correctly perform bounds checking
when processing the SerialNumber field of USB devices. An attacker with
physical access could use this to crash usbmuxd or potentially execute
arbitrary code as the 'usbmux' user.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  libusbmuxd1                     1.0.7-1ubuntu0.11.10.1

Ubuntu 11.04:
  libusbmuxd1                     1.0.7-1ubuntu0.11.04.1

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

mozvoikko update
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

This update provides compatible Mozvoikko packages for the latest Firefox.

Software Description:
- mozvoikko: Finnish spell-checker extension for Firefox

Details:

USN-1355-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. This update provides an
updated Mozvoikko package for use with the latest Firefox.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that if a user chose to export their Firefox Sync key
 the "Firefox Recovery Key.html" file is saved with incorrect permissions,
 making the file contents potentially readable by other users.
 (CVE-2012-0450)
 
 Nicolas Gregoire and Aki Helin discovered that when processing a malformed
 embedded XSLT stylesheet, Firefox can crash due to memory corruption. If
 the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker
 could exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or
 potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.
 (CVE-2012-0449)
 
 It was discovered that memory corruption could occur during the decoding of
 Ogg Vorbis files. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted
 file, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via
 application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the
 user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-0444)
 
 Tim Abraldes discovered that when encoding certain images types the
 resulting data was always a fixed size. There is the possibility of
 sensitive data from uninitialized memory being appended to these images.
 (CVE-2012-0447)
 
 It was discovered that Firefox did not properly perform XPConnect security
 checks. An attacker could exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting
 (XSS) attacks through web pages and Firefox extensions. With cross-site
 scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially
 crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents,
 or steal confidential data, within the same domain. (CVE-2012-0446)
 
 It was discovered that Firefox did not properly handle node removal in the
 DOM. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an
 attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via application
 crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking
 Firefox. (CVE-2011-3659)
 
 Alex Dvorov discovered that Firefox did not properly handle sub-frames in
 form submissions. An attacker could exploit this to conduct phishing
 attacks using HTML5 frames. (CVE-2012-0445)
 
 Ben Hawkes, Christian Holler, Honza Bombas, Jason Orendorff, Jesse
 Ruderman, Jan Odvarko, Peter Van Der Beken, Bob Clary, and Bill McCloskey
 discovered memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were tricked
 into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit these to
 cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute
 code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-0442,
 CVE-2012-0443)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  xul-ext-mozvoikko               2.0.1-0ubuntu0.11.10.1

Ubuntu 11.04:
  xul-ext-mozvoikko               2.0.1-0ubuntu0.11.04.1

Ubuntu 10.10:

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1357-1
February 09, 2012

openssl vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

Summary:

Multiple vulnerabilities exist in OpenSSL that could expose
sensitive information or cause applications to crash.

Software Description:
- openssl: Secure Socket Layer (SSL) binary and related cryptographic tools

Details:

It was discovered that the elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) subsystem
in OpenSSL, when using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm
(ECDSA) for the ECDHE_ECDSA cipher suite, did not properly implement
curves over binary fields. This could allow an attacker to determine
private keys via a timing attack. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04
LTS, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.10 and Ubuntu 11.04. (CVE-2011-1945)

Adam Langley discovered that the ephemeral Elliptic Curve
Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) functionality in OpenSSL did not ensure thread
safety while processing handshake messages from clients. This
could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service via
out-of-order messages that violate the TLS protocol. This issue only
affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.10 and Ubuntu
11.04. (CVE-2011-3210)

Nadhem Alfardan and Kenny Paterson discovered that the Datagram
Transport Layer Security (DTLS) implementation in OpenSSL performed a
MAC check only if certain padding is valid. This could allow a remote
attacker to recover plaintext. (CVE-2011-4108)

Antonio Martin discovered that a flaw existed in the fix to address
CVE-2011-4108, the DTLS MAC check failure. This could allow a remote
attacker to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-0050)

Ben Laurie discovered a double free vulnerability in OpenSSL that could
be triggered when the X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK flag is enabled. This
could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service. This
issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.10
and Ubuntu 11.04. (CVE-2011-4109)

It was discovered that OpenSSL, in certain circumstances involving
ECDH or ECDHE cipher suites, used an incorrect modular reduction
algorithm in its implementation of the P-256 and P-384 NIST elliptic
curves. This could allow a remote attacker to obtain the private
key of a TLS server via multiple handshake attempts. This issue only
affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. (CVE-2011-4354)

Adam Langley discovered that the SSL 3.0 implementation in OpenSSL
did not properly initialize data structures for block cipher
padding. This could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive
information. (CVE-2011-4576)

Andrew Chi discovered that OpenSSL, when RFC 3779 support is enabled,
could trigger an assert when handling an X.509 certificate containing
certificate-extension data associated with IP address blocks or
Autonomous System (AS) identifiers. This could allow a remote attacker
to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-4577)

Adam Langley discovered that the Server Gated Cryptography (SGC)
implementation in OpenSSL did not properly handle handshake
restarts. This could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of
service. (CVE-2011-4619)

Andrey Kulikov discovered that the GOST block cipher engine in OpenSSL
did not properly handle invalid parameters. This could allow a remote
attacker to cause a denial of service via crafted data from a TLS
client. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.10. (CVE-2012-0027)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  libssl1.0.0                     1.0.0e-2ubuntu4.2
  openssl                         1.0.0e-2ubuntu4.2

Ubuntu 11.04:
  libssl0.9.8                     0.9.8o-5ubuntu1.2
  openssl                         0.9.8o-5ubuntu1.2

Ubuntu 10.10:

  openssl                         0.9.8o-1ubuntu4.6

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  libssl0.9.8                     0.9.8k-7ubuntu8.8
  openssl                         0.9.8k-7ubuntu8.8

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS:
  libssl0.9.8                     0.9.8g-4ubuntu3.15
  openssl                         0.9.8g-4ubuntu3.15

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

php5 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

Summary:

Multiple vulnerabilities in PHP.

Software Description:
- php5: HTML-embedded scripting language interpreter

Details:

It was discovered that PHP computed hash values for form parameters
without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably.
This could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service by
sending many crafted parameters. (CVE-2011-4885)

ATTENTION: this update changes previous PHP behavior by
limiting the number of external input variables to 1000.
This may be increased by adding a "max_input_vars"
directive to the php.ini configuration file. See
http://www.php.net/manual/en/info.configuration.php#ini.max-input-vars
for more information.

Stefan Esser discovered that the fix to address the predictable hash
collision issue, CVE-2011-4885, did not properly handle the situation
where the limit was reached. This could allow a remote attacker to
cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code via a request
containing a large number of variables. (CVE-2012-0830)

It was discovered that PHP did not always check the return value of
the zend_strndup function. This could allow a remote attacker to
cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-4153)

It was discovered that PHP did not properly enforce libxslt security
settings. This could allow a remote attacker to create arbitrary
files via a crafted XSLT stylesheet that uses the libxslt output
extension. (CVE-2012-0057)

It was discovered that PHP did not properly enforce that PDORow
objects could not be serialized and not be saved in a session. A
remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service via an
application crash. (CVE-2012-0788)

It was discovered that PHP allowed the magic_quotes_gpc setting to
be disabled remotely. This could allow a remote attacker to bypass
restrictions that could prevent an SQL injection. (CVE-2012-0831)

USN 1126-1 addressed an issue where the /etc/cron.d/php5 cron job
for PHP allowed local users to delete arbitrary files via a symlink
attack on a directory under /var/lib/php5/. Emese Revfy discovered
that the fix had not been applied to PHP for Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. This
update corrects the issue. We apologize for the error. (CVE-2011-0441)

- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

Summary:

USN 1358-1 introduced a regression in PHP.

Software Description:
- php5: HTML-embedded scripting language interpreter

Details:

USN 1358-1 fixed multiple vulnerabilities in PHP. The fix for
CVE-2012-0831 introduced a regression where the state of the

February 13, 2012

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.10

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:

Details:

Han-Wen Nienhuys reported a flaw in the FUSE kernel module. A local user
who can mount a FUSE file system could cause a denial of service.
(CVE-2011-3353)

A flaw was found in KVM's Programmable Interval Timer (PIT). When a virtual
interrupt control is not available a local user could use this to cause a
denial of service by starting a timer. (CVE-2011-4622)

A flaw was discovered in the XFS filesystem. If a local user mounts a
specially crafted XFS image it could potential execute arbitrary code on
the system. (CVE-2012-0038)

Chen Haogang discovered an integer overflow that could result in memory
corruption. A local unprivileged user could use this to crash the system.
(CVE-2012-0044)

Andy Whitcroft discovered a that the Overlayfs filesystem was not doing the
extended permission checks needed by cgroups and Linux Security Modules
(LSMs). A local user could exploit this to by-pass security policy and
access files that should not be accessible. (CVE-2012-0055)

A flaw was found in the linux kernels IPv4 IGMP query processing. A remote
attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-0207)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  linux-image-3.0.0-16-generic    3.0.0-16.28
  linux-image-3.0.0-16-generic-pae  3.0.0-16.28

  linux-image-3.0.0-16-virtual    3.0.0-16.28

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Subject: [USN-1284-2] Update Manager regression
Message-ID: <1329419220.26299.41.camel@mdlinux>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1284-2
February 16, 2012

update-manager regression
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

Summary:

USN-1284-1 introduced a regression in Update Manager.

Software Description:
- update-manager: GNOME application that manages apt updates

Details:

USN-1284-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Update Manager. One of the fixes
introduced a regression for Kubuntu users attempting to upgrade to a newer
Ubuntu release. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 David Black discovered that Update Manager incorrectly extracted the
 downloaded upgrade tarball before verifying its GPG signature. If a remote
 attacker were able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could
 potentially be used to replace arbitrary files. (CVE-2011-3152)
 
 David Black discovered that Update Manager created a temporary directory
 in an insecure fashion. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to
 read the XAUTHORITY file of the user performing the upgrade.
 (CVE-2011-3154)
 
 This update also adds a hotfix to Update Notifier to handle cases where the
 upgrade is being performed from CD media.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  update-manager-core             1:0.152.25.8

Ubuntu 11.04:
  update-manager-core             1:0.150.5.2

Ubuntu 10.10:
  update-manager-core             1:0.142.23.2

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  update-manager-core             1:0.134.11.2

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS:
  update-manager-core             1:0.87.33

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

It was discovered that the Apache HTTP Server incorrectly handled the
SetEnvIf .htaccess file directive. An attacker having write access to a
.htaccess file may exploit this to possibly execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2011-3607)

Prutha Parikh discovered that the mod_proxy module did not properly
interact with the RewriteRule and ProxyPassMatch pattern matches in the
configuration of a reverse proxy. This could allow remote attackers to
contact internal webservers behind the proxy that were not intended for
external exposure. (CVE-2011-4317)

Rainer Canavan discovered that the mod_log_config module incorrectly
handled a certain format string when used with a threaded MPM. A remote
attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via a specially-
crafted cookie. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04 and 11.10.
(CVE-2012-0021)

It was discovered that the Apache HTTP Server incorrectly handled certain
type fields within a scoreboard shared memory segment. A local attacker
could exploit this to to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-0031)

Norman Hippert discovered that the Apache HTTP Server incorrecly handled
header information when returning a Bad Request (400) error page. A remote
attacker could exploit this to obtain the values of certain HTTPOnly
cookies. (CVE-2012-0053)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  apache2.2-common                2.2.20-1ubuntu1.2

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1369-1
February 17, 2012

thunderbird vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird.

Software Description:
- thunderbird: Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

Details:

Nicolas Gregoire and Aki Helin discovered that when processing a malformed
embedded XSLT stylesheet, Thunderbird can crash due to memory corruption.
If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker
could exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or
potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking
Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-0449)

It was discovered that memory corruption could occur during the decoding of
Ogg Vorbis files. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted
file, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via
application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the
user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-0444)

Tim Abraldes discovered that when encoding certain image types the
resulting data was always a fixed size. There is the possibility of
sensitive data from uninitialized memory being appended to these images.
(CVE-2012-0447)

It was discovered that Thunderbird did not properly perform XPConnect
security checks. An attacker could exploit this to conduct cross-site
scripting (XSS) attacks through web pages and Thunderbird extensions. With
cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a
specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the
contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain.
(CVE-2012-0446)

It was discovered that Thunderbird did not properly handle node removal in
the DOM. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an
attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via application
crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking
Thunderbird. (CVE-2011-3659)

Alex Dvorov discovered that Thunderbird did not properly handle sub-frames
in form submissions. An attacker could exploit this to conduct phishing
attacks using HTML5 frames. (CVE-2012-0445)

Ben Hawkes, Christian Holler, Honza Bombas, Jason Orendorff, Jesse
Ruderman, Jan Odvarko, Peter Van Der Beken, Bob Clary, and Bill McCloskey
discovered memory safety issues affecting Thunderbird. If the user were
tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit
these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially
execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.
(CVE-2012-0442, CVE-2012-0443)

Andrew McCreight and Olli Pettay discovered a use-after-free vulnerability
in the XBL bindings. An attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of
service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the
privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-0452)

Jueri Aedla discovered that libpng, which is in Thunderbird, did not
properly verify the size used when allocating memory during chunk
decompression. If a user or automated system using libpng were tricked into
opening a specially crafted image, an attacker could exploit this to cause
a denial of service or execute code with the privileges of the user
invoking the program. (CVE-2011-3026)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  thunderbird                     10.0.2+build1-0ubuntu0.11.10.1

After a standard system update you need to restart Thunderbird to make
all the necessary changes.

Subject: [USN-1372-1] Puppet vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <1330006000.3422.12.camel@localhost>

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1372-1
February 23, 2012

puppet vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Puppet could be made to overwrite files and run programs with administrator
privileges.

Software Description:
- puppet: Centralized configuration management

Details:

It was discovered that Puppet did not drop privileges when executing
commands as different users. If an attacker had control of the execution
manifests or the executed command, this could be used to execute code with
elevated group permissions (typically root). (CVE-2012-1053)

It was discovered that Puppet unsafely opened files when the k5login type
is used to manage files. A local attacker could exploit this to overwrite
arbitrary files and escalate privileges. (CVE-2012-1054)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.10:
  puppet-common                   2.7.1-1ubuntu3.5

Ubuntu 11.04:
  puppet-common                   2.6.4-2ubuntu2.8

Ubuntu 10.10:
  puppet-common                   2.6.1-0ubuntu2.6

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  puppet-common                   0.25.4-2ubuntu6.6

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

openjdk-6 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.10
- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Multiple OpenJDK 6 vulnerabilities have been fixed.

Software Description:
- openjdk-6: Open Source Java implementation

Details:

It was discovered that the Java HttpServer class did not limit the
number of headers read from a HTTP request. A remote attacker could
cause a denial of service by sending special requests that trigger
hash collisions predictably. (CVE-2011-5035)

ATTENTION: this update changes previous Java HttpServer class behavior
by limiting the number of request headers to 200. This may be increased
by adjusting the sun.net.httpserver.maxReqHeaders property.

It was discovered that the Java Sound component did not properly
check buffer boundaries. A remote attacker could use this to cause
a denial of service or view confidential data. (CVE-2011-3563)

It was discovered that the Java2D implementation does not properly
check graphics rendering objects before passing them to the native
renderer. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service or to bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2012-0497)

It was discovered that an off-by-one error exists in the Java ZIP
file processing code. An attacker could us this to cause a denial of
service through a maliciously crafted ZIP file. (CVE-2012-0501)

It was discovered that the Java AWT KeyboardFocusManager did not
properly enforce keyboard focus security policy. A remote attacker
could use this with an untrusted application or applet to grab keyboard
focus and possibly expose confidential data. (CVE-2012-0502)

It was discovered that the Java TimeZone class did not properly enforce
security policy around setting the default time zone. A remote attacker
could use this with an untrusted application or applet to set a new
default time zone and bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2012-0503)

It was discovered the Java ObjectStreamClass did not throw
an accurately identifiable exception when a deserialization
failure occurred. A remote attacker could use this with
an untrusted application or applet to bypass Java sandbox
restrictions. (CVE-2012-0505)

It was discovered that the Java CORBA implementation did not properly
protect repository identifiers on certain CORBA objects. A remote
attacker could use this to corrupt object data. (CVE-2012-0506)

It was discovered that the Java AtomicReferenceArray class
implementation did not properly check if an array was of
the expected Object[] type. A remote attacker could use this
with a malicious application or applet to bypass Java sandbox
restrictions. (CVE-2012-0507)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following

Several security issues were fixed in PostgreSQL.

Software Description:
- postgresql-9.1: Object-relational SQL database
- postgresql-8.4: Object-relational SQL database
- postgresql-8.3: Object-relational SQL database

Details:

It was discovered that PostgreSQL incorrectly checked permissions on
functions called by a trigger. An attacker could attach a trigger to a
table they owned and possibly escalate privileges. (CVE-2012-0866)

It was discovered that PostgreSQL incorrectly truncated SSL certificate
name checks to 32 characters. If a host name was exactly 32 characters,
this issue could be exploited by an attacker to spoof the SSL certificate.
This issue affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.10, Ubuntu 11.04 and
Ubuntu 11.10. (CVE-2012-0867)

It was discovered that the PostgreSQL pg_dump utility incorrectly filtered

handling of IPv4 icmp packets. A remote user could exploit this to cause a
denial of service. (CVE-2011-1927)

A flaw was found in the Linux Ethernet bridge's handling of IGMP (Internet
Group Management Protocol) packets. An unprivileged local user could
exploit this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2011-0716)

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's AppArmor security interface
when invalid information was written to it. An unprivileged local user
could use this to cause a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2011-3619)

linux vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.04

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

The linux kernel did not properly account for PTE pages when deciding which
task to kill in out of memory conditions. A local, unprivileged could
exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2498)

A flaw was discovered in the TOMOYO LSM's handling of mount system calls.
An unprivileged user could oops the system causing a denial of service.
(CVE-2011-2518)

A bug was discovered in the Linux kernel's calculation of OOM (Out of
memory) scores, that would result in the wrong process being killed. A user
could use this to kill the process with the highest OOM score, even if that
process belongs to another user or the system. (CVE-2011-4097)

A flaw was found in the linux kernels IPv4 IGMP query processing. A remote
attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-0207)
