{"special":"The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:\nAfter a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make\nall the necessary changes.\nATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have\nbeen given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and\nreinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","threat":["A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash).","A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (panic).","A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service.","A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (panic)."],"update":{"14.04":[{"package":"linux-image-3.16.0-28-generic","version":"3.16.0-28.37~14.04.1"},{"version":"3.16.0-28.37~14.04.1","package":"linux-image-3.16.0-28-generic-lpae"},{"version":"3.16.0-28.37~14.04.1","package":"linux-image-3.16.0-28-lowlatency"},{"package":"linux-image-3.16.0-28-powerpc-e500mc","version":"3.16.0-28.37~14.04.1"},{"version":"3.16.0-28.37~14.04.1","package":"linux-image-3.16.0-28-powerpc-smp"},{"package":"linux-image-3.16.0-28-powerpc64-emb","version":"3.16.0-28.37~14.04.1"},{"version":"3.16.0-28.37~14.04.1","package":"linux-image-3.16.0-28-powerpc64-smp"}]},"date":"December 12, 2014","usn":"USN-2447-1","CVEs":["CVE-2014-3673","CVE-2014-3687","CVE-2014-3688","CVE-2014-7825","CVE-2014-7826","CVE-2014-7970","CVE-2014-8086","CVE-2014-8134","CVE-2014-8369","CVE-2014-9090"],"info":"linux-lts-utopic vulnerabilities"}
