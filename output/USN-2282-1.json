If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","threat":["A local attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially sensitive single-bit values from kernel memory or cause a denial of service (OOPS).","An attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or OOPS)."],"update":{"10.04":[{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-64-386","version":"2.6.32-64.128"},{"version":"2.6.32-64.128","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-64-generic"},{"version":"2.6.32-64.128","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-64-generic-pae"},{"version":"2.6.32-64.128","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-64-ia64"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-64-lpia","version":"2.6.32-64.128"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-64-powerpc","version":"2.6.32-64.128"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-64-powerpc-smp","version":"2.6.32-64.128"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-64-powerpc64-smp","version":"2.6.32-64.128"},{"version":"2.6.32-64.128","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-64-preempt"},{"version":"2.6.32-64.128","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-64-server"},{"version":"2.6.32-64.128","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-64-sparc64"},{"version":"2.6.32-64.128","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-64-sparc64-smp"},{"version":"2.6.32-64.128","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-64-versatile"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-64-virtual","version":"2.6.32-64.128"}]}}
