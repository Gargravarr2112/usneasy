If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","update":{"15.04":[{"package":"linux-image-3.19.0-25-generic","version":"3.19.0-25.26"},{"version":"3.19.0-25.26","package":"linux-image-3.19.0-25-generic-lpae"},{"package":"linux-image-3.19.0-25-lowlatency","version":"3.19.0-25.26"},{"package":"linux-image-3.19.0-25-powerpc-e500mc","version":"3.19.0-25.26"},{"version":"3.19.0-25.26","package":"linux-image-3.19.0-25-powerpc-smp"},{"version":"3.19.0-25.26","package":"linux-image-3.19.0-25-powerpc64-emb"},{"version":"3.19.0-25.26","package":"linux-image-3.19.0-25-powerpc64-smp"}]},"date":"July 28, 2015"}
