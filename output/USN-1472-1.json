If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","update":{"11.10":[{"package":"linux-image-3.0.0-21-generic","version":"3.0.0-21.35"},{"package":"linux-image-3.0.0-21-generic-pae","version":"3.0.0-21.35"},{"package":"linux-image-3.0.0-21-omap","version":"3.0.0-21.35"},{"version":"3.0.0-21.35","package":"linux-image-3.0.0-21-powerpc"},{"version":"3.0.0-21.35","package":"linux-image-3.0.0-21-powerpc-smp"},{"package":"linux-image-3.0.0-21-powerpc64-smp","version":"3.0.0-21.35"},{"package":"linux-image-3.0.0-21-server","version":"3.0.0-21.35"},{"version":"3.0.0-21.35","package":"linux-image-3.0.0-21-virtual"}]}}
