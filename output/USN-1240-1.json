If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","usn":"USN-1240-1","CVEs":["CVE-2011-1576","CVE-2011-1833","CVE-2011-2494","CVE-2011-2495","CVE-2011-2497","CVE-2011-2695","CVE-2011-2699","CVE-2011-2905","CVE-2011-2928","CVE-2011-3188","CVE-2011-3191"],"threat":["On some systems, a remote attacker could send specially crafted traffic to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.","A local attacker could exploit this to trick the system into unmounting arbitrary mount points, leading to a denial of service.","A local attacker could exploit this to read certain information, leading to a loss of privacy.","A local attacker could exploit this to read certain information, leading to a loss of privacy.","If a system was using Bluetooth, a remote attacker could send specially crafted traffic to crash the system or gain root privileges.","A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.","A remote attacker could exploit this to exhaust network resources, leading to a denial of service.","If a privileged user were tricked into running perf in a directory containing a malicious configuration file, an attacker could run arbitrary commands and possibly gain privileges.","A local attacker could exploit this with a malformed Be filesystem and crash the system, leading to a denial of service.","An attacker could use this flaw to possibly predict sequence numbers and inject packets.","A remote attacker with a malicious server could exploit this to crash the system or possibly execute arbitrary code as the root user."],"info":"linux-mvl-dove vulnerabilities"}
