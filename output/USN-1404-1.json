If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","update":{"11.10":[{"version":"3.0.0-1208.18","package":"linux-image-3.0.0-1208-omap4"}]},"usn":"USN-1404-1","threat":["An attacker on the local network could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service.."],"date":"March 27, 2012","info":"linux-ti-omap4 vulnerability","CVEs":["CVE-2011-3347"]}
