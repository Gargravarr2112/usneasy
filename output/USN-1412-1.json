If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","update":{"11.10":[{"version":"3.0.0-17.30","package":"linux-image-3.0.0-17-generic"},{"package":"linux-image-3.0.0-17-generic-pae","version":"3.0.0-17.30"},{"version":"3.0.0-17.30","package":"linux-image-3.0.0-17-omap"},{"version":"3.0.0-17.30","package":"linux-image-3.0.0-17-powerpc"},{"package":"linux-image-3.0.0-17-powerpc-smp","version":"3.0.0-17.30"},{"package":"linux-image-3.0.0-17-powerpc64-smp","version":"3.0.0-17.30"},{"package":"linux-image-3.0.0-17-server","version":"3.0.0-17.30"},{"package":"linux-image-3.0.0-17-virtual","version":"3.0.0-17.30"}]}}
