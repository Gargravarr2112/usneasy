If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","update":{"10.04":[{"version":"2.6.32-37.81","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-37-386"},{"version":"2.6.32-37.81","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-37-generic"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-37-generic-pae","version":"2.6.32-37.81"},{"version":"2.6.32-37.81","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-37-ia64"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-37-lpia","version":"2.6.32-37.81"},{"version":"2.6.32-37.81","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-37-powerpc"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-37-powerpc-smp","version":"2.6.32-37.81"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-37-powerpc64-smp","version":"2.6.32-37.81"},{"version":"2.6.32-37.81","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-37-preempt"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-37-server","version":"2.6.32-37.81"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-37-sparc64","version":"2.6.32-37.81"},{"version":"2.6.32-37.81","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-37-sparc64-smp"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-37-versatile","version":"2.6.32-37.81"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-37-virtual","version":"2.6.32-37.81"}]}}
