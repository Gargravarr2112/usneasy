If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","update":{"11.10":[{"package":"linux-image-3.0.0-26-generic","version":"3.0.0-26.42"},{"package":"linux-image-3.0.0-26-generic-pae","version":"3.0.0-26.42"},{"version":"3.0.0-26.42","package":"linux-image-3.0.0-26-omap"},{"package":"linux-image-3.0.0-26-powerpc","version":"3.0.0-26.42"},{"package":"linux-image-3.0.0-26-powerpc-smp","version":"3.0.0-26.42"},{"version":"3.0.0-26.42","package":"linux-image-3.0.0-26-powerpc64-smp"},{"version":"3.0.0-26.42","package":"linux-image-3.0.0-26-server"},{"version":"3.0.0-26.42","package":"linux-image-3.0.0-26-virtual"}]},"usn":"USN-1568-1"}
