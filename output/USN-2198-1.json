If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","update":{"12.04":[{"package":"linux-image-3.2.0-61-generic","version":"3.2.0-61.93"},{"package":"linux-image-3.2.0-61-generic-pae","version":"3.2.0-61.93"},{"version":"3.2.0-61.93","package":"linux-image-3.2.0-61-highbank"},{"package":"linux-image-3.2.0-61-omap","version":"3.2.0-61.93"},{"version":"3.2.0-61.93","package":"linux-image-3.2.0-61-powerpc-smp"},{"package":"linux-image-3.2.0-61-powerpc64-smp","version":"3.2.0-61.93"},{"version":"3.2.0-61.93","package":"linux-image-3.2.0-61-virtual"}]},"usn":"USN-2198-1"}
