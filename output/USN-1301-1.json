{"special":"The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:\nAfter a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make\nall the necessary changes.\nATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have             \nbeen given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and            \nreinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If           \nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as            \nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you          \nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,      \nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically      \nperform this as well.
