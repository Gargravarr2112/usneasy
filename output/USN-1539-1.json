If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","update":{"10.04":[{"version":"3.0.0-24.40~lucid1","package":"linux-image-3.0.0-24-generic"},{"package":"linux-image-3.0.0-24-generic-pae","version":"3.0.0-24.40~lucid1"},{"package":"linux-image-3.0.0-24-server","version":"3.0.0-24.40~lucid1"},{"package":"linux-image-3.0.0-24-virtual","version":"3.0.0-24.40~lucid1"}]},"date":"August 14, 2012"}
