If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","update":{"12.10":[{"version":"3.5.0-42.65","package":"linux-image-3.5.0-42-generic"},{"version":"3.5.0-42.65","package":"linux-image-3.5.0-42-highbank"},{"version":"3.5.0-42.65","package":"linux-image-3.5.0-42-omap"},{"version":"3.5.0-42.65","package":"linux-image-3.5.0-42-powerpc-smp"},{"version":"3.5.0-42.65","package":"linux-image-3.5.0-42-powerpc64-smp"}]},"usn":"USN-1996-1"}
