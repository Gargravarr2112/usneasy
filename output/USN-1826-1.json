If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","update":{"12.10":[{"version":"3.5.0-30.51","package":"linux-image-3.5.0-30-generic"},{"version":"3.5.0-30.51","package":"linux-image-3.5.0-30-highbank"},{"version":"3.5.0-30.51","package":"linux-image-3.5.0-30-omap"},{"package":"linux-image-3.5.0-30-powerpc-smp","version":"3.5.0-30.51"},{"package":"linux-image-3.5.0-30-powerpc64-smp","version":"3.5.0-30.51"}]}}
