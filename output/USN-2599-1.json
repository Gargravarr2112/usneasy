{"special":"The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:\nAfter a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make\nall the necessary changes.\nATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have\nbeen given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and\nreinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","threat":["A local attacker could exploit this race by using chown on a setuid-user-binary to gain administrative privileges.."],"update":{"14.04":[{"version":"3.16.0-37.49~14.04.1","package":"linux-image-3.16.0-37-generic"},{"package":"linux-image-3.16.0-37-generic-lpae","version":"3.16.0-37.49~14.04.1"},{"package":"linux-image-3.16.0-37-lowlatency","version":"3.16.0-37.49~14.04.1"},{"package":"linux-image-3.16.0-37-powerpc-e500mc","version":"3.16.0-37.49~14.04.1"},{"version":"3.16.0-37.49~14.04.1","package":"linux-image-3.16.0-37-powerpc-smp"},{"package":"linux-image-3.16.0-37-powerpc64-emb","version":"3.16.0-37.49~14.04.1"},{"version":"3.16.0-37.49~14.04.1","package":"linux-image-3.16.0-37-powerpc64-smp"}]},"date":"May 05, 2015","usn":"USN-2599-1","CVEs":["CVE-2015-3339"],"info":"linux-lts-utopic vulnerability"}
