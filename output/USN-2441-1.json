If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","update":{"10.04":[{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-70-386","version":"2.6.32-70.137"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-70-generic","version":"2.6.32-70.137"},{"version":"2.6.32-70.137","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-70-generic-pae"},{"version":"2.6.32-70.137","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-70-ia64"},{"version":"2.6.32-70.137","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-70-lpia"},{"version":"2.6.32-70.137","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-70-powerpc"},{"version":"2.6.32-70.137","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-70-powerpc-smp"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-70-powerpc64-smp","version":"2.6.32-70.137"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-70-preempt","version":"2.6.32-70.137"},{"version":"2.6.32-70.137","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-70-server"},{"version":"2.6.32-70.137","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-70-sparc64"},{"version":"2.6.32-70.137","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-70-sparc64-smp"},{"version":"2.6.32-70.137","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-70-versatile"},{"version":"2.6.32-70.137","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-70-virtual"}]}}
