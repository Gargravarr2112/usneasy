If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","threat":["A local attacker could exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges."],"update":{"10.04":[{"version":"2.6.32-375.92","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-375-ec2"}]}}
