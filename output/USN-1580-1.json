If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","threat":null,"update":{"12.04":[{"package":"linux-image-3.2.0-1419-omap4","version":"3.2.0-1419.26"}]},"date":"September 21, 2012","usn":"USN-1580-1","CVEs":["CVE-2012-3412","CVE-2012-3430"],"info":"linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities"}
