{"special":"The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:\nAfter a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make\nall the necessary changes.\nATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have\nbeen given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and\nreinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","update":{"11.04":[{"version":"2.6.38-10.46","package":"linux-image-2.6.38-10-generic"},{"version":"2.6.38-10.46","package":"linux-image-2.6.38-10-generic-pae"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.38-10-omap","version":"2.6.38-10.46"},{"version":"2.6.38-10.46","package":"linux-image-2.6.38-10-powerpc"},{"version":"2.6.38-10.46","package":"linux-image-2.6.38-10-powerpc-smp"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.38-10-powerpc64-smp","version":"2.6.38-10.46"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.38-10-server","version":"2.6.38-10.46"},{"version":"2.6.38-10.46","package":"linux-image-2.6.38-10-versatile"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.38-10-virtual","version":"2.6.38-10.46"}]},"date":"July
