If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","threat":["A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (buffer over- read) via a specially crafted header."],"update":{"13.04":[{"version":"3.8.0-35.50","package":"linux-image-3.8.0-35-generic"}]},"date":"January 03, 2014","usn":"USN-2073-1","info":"linux vulnerabilities","CVEs":["CVE-2013-4470","CVE-2013-4511","CVE-2013-4513","CVE-2013-4514","CVE-2013-4515","CVE-2013-4516","CVE-2013-6383","CVE-2013-6763","CVE-2013-7027"]}
