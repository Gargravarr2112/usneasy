{"special":"The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:\nAfter a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make\nall the necessary changes.\nATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have\nbeen given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and\nreinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","threat":["A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash).","A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service using a flood of UDP packets with invalid checksums.","A remote attacker can cause a denial of service against applications that use epoll by injecting a single packet with an invalid checksum."],"update":{"14.04":[{"version":"3.19.0-23.24~14.04.1","package":"linux-image-3.19.0-23-generic"},{"package":"linux-image-3.19.0-23-generic-lpae","version":"3.19.0-23.24~14.04.1"},{"package":"linux-image-3.19.0-23-lowlatency","version":"3.19.0-23.24~14.04.1"},{"version":"3.19.0-23.24~14.04.1","package":"linux-image-3.19.0-23-powerpc-e500mc"},{"version":"3.19.0-23.24~14.04.1","package":"linux-image-3.19.0-23-powerpc-smp"},{"version":"3.19.0-23.24~14.04.1","package":"linux-image-3.19.0-23-powerpc64-emb"},{"package":"linux-image-3.19.0-23-powerpc64-smp","version":"3.19.0-23.24~14.04.1"}]},"date":"July 23, 2015","usn":"USN-2683-1","CVEs":["CVE-2015-4692","CVE-2015-4700","CVE-2015-5364","CVE-2015-5366"],"info":"linux-lts-vivid vulnerabilities"}
