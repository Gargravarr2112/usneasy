If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","threat":null,"update":{"14.04":[{"package":"linux-image-3.13.0-59-generic","version":"3.13.0-59.98"},{"package":"linux-image-3.13.0-59-generic-lpae","version":"3.13.0-59.98"},{"version":"3.13.0-59.98","package":"linux-image-3.13.0-59-lowlatency"},{"package":"linux-image-3.13.0-59-powerpc-e500","version":"3.13.0-59.98"},{"version":"3.13.0-59.98","package":"linux-image-3.13.0-59-powerpc-e500mc"},{"package":"linux-image-3.13.0-59-powerpc-smp","version":"3.13.0-59.98"},{"version":"3.13.0-59.98","package":"linux-image-3.13.0-59-powerpc64-emb"},{"package":"linux-image-3.13.0-59-powerpc64-smp","version":"3.13.0-59.98"}]}}
