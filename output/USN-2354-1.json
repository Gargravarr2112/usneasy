If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","threat":["An attacker who can mount a custom iso9660 image either via a CD/DVD drive or a loopback mount could cause a denial of service (system crash or reboot).","An attacker who can mount a custom iso9660 image, with a self-referential CL entry, either via a CD/DVD drive or a loopback mount could cause a denial of service (unkillable mount process)."],"update":{"10.04":[{"version":"2.6.32-66.132","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-66-386"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-66-generic","version":"2.6.32-66.132"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-66-generic-pae","version":"2.6.32-66.132"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-66-ia64","version":"2.6.32-66.132"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-66-lpia","version":"2.6.32-66.132"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-66-powerpc","version":"2.6.32-66.132"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-66-powerpc-smp","version":"2.6.32-66.132"},{"version":"2.6.32-66.132","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-66-powerpc64-smp"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-66-preempt","version":"2.6.32-66.132"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-66-server","version":"2.6.32-66.132"},{"version":"2.6.32-66.132","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-66-sparc64"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-66-sparc64-smp","version":"2.6.32-66.132"},{"version":"2.6.32-66.132","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-66-versatile"},{"version":"2.6.32-66.132","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-66-virtual"}]}}
