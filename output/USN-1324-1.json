{"special":"The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:\nAfter a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make\nall the necessary changes.\nATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have\nbeen given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and\nreinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","threat":["A local attacker could exploit this to cause a kernel oops."],"update":{"10.04":[{"version":"2.6.32-342.43","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-342-ec2"}]},"date":"January 11, 2012","usn":"USN-1324-1","info":"linux-ec2 vulnerabilities","CVEs":["CVE-2011-2203","CVE-2011-4110"]}
