If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","usn":"USN-1241-1","CVEs":["CVE-2011-1573","CVE-2011-1576","CVE-2011-1776","CVE-2011-2213","CVE-2011-2494","CVE-2011-2495","CVE-2011-2496","CVE-2011-2497","CVE-2011-2517","CVE-2011-2525","CVE-2011-2695","CVE-2011-2723","CVE-2011-2905","CVE-2011-2909","CVE-2011-2928","CVE-2011-3188","CVE-2011-3191","CVE-2011-3363"],"threat":["If the net.sctp.addip_enable variable was turned on, a remote attacker could send specially crafted traffic to crash the system.","On some systems, a remote attacker could send specially crafted traffic to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.","A physically local attacker that could insert mountable devices could exploit this to crash the system or possibly gain root privileges.","A local attacker could exploit this to consume CPU resources, leading to a denial of service.","A local attacker could exploit this to read certain information, leading to a loss of privacy.","A local attacker could exploit this to read certain information, leading to a loss of privacy.","A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.","If a system was using Bluetooth, a remote attacker could send specially crafted traffic to crash the system or gain root privileges.","A local attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service or gain root privileges.","A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.","A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.","If a privileged user were tricked into running perf in a directory containing a malicious configuration file, an attacker could run arbitrary commands and possibly gain privileges.","A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy.","A local attacker could exploit this with a malformed Be filesystem and crash the system, leading to a denial of service.","An attacker could use this flaw to possibly predict sequence numbers and inject packets.","A remote attacker with a malicious server could exploit this to crash the system or possibly execute arbitrary code as the root user.","A local attacker with access to a CIFS partition could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service."],"info":"linux-fsl-imx51 vulnerabilities"}
