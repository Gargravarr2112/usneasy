If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","threat":["An attacker on the local area network (LAN) could potential exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash of targeted system).","An unprivileged local attacker could exploit this flaw to increase their privileges on the system.","A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially escalate privileges on Intel base machines with AEC-GCM mode IPSec security association."],"update":{"14.04":[{"version":"3.13.0-53.88","package":"linux-image-3.13.0-53-generic"},{"package":"linux-image-3.13.0-53-generic-lpae","version":"3.13.0-53.88"},{"version":"3.13.0-53.88","package":"linux-image-3.13.0-53-lowlatency"},{"version":"3.13.0-53.88","package":"linux-image-3.13.0-53-powerpc-e500"},{"package":"linux-image-3.13.0-53-powerpc-e500mc","version":"3.13.0-53.88"},{"package":"linux-image-3.13.0-53-powerpc-smp","version":"3.13.0-53.88"},{"version":"3.13.0-53.88","package":"linux-image-3.13.0-53-powerpc64-emb"},{"package":"linux-image-3.13.0-53-powerpc64-smp","version":"3.13.0-53.88"}]}}
