If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","update":{"12.04":[{"package":"linux-image-3.2.0-51-generic","version":"3.2.0-51.77"},{"version":"3.2.0-51.77","package":"linux-image-3.2.0-51-generic-pae"},{"package":"linux-image-3.2.0-51-highbank","version":"3.2.0-51.77"},{"package":"linux-image-3.2.0-51-omap","version":"3.2.0-51.77"},{"version":"3.2.0-51.77","package":"linux-image-3.2.0-51-powerpc-smp"},{"version":"3.2.0-51.77","package":"linux-image-3.2.0-51-powerpc64-smp"},{"version":"3.2.0-51.77","package":"linux-image-3.2.0-51-virtual"}]},"date":"July 29, 2013"}
