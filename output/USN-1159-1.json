If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","CVEs":["CVE-2010-4243","CVE-2010-4263","CVE-2010-4342","CVE-2010-4529","CVE-2010-4565","CVE-2011-0463","CVE-2011-0695","CVE-2011-0711","CVE-2011-0726","CVE-2011-1013","CVE-2011-1016","CVE-2011-1017","CVE-2011-1019","CVE-2011-1090","CVE-2011-1163","CVE-2011-1170","CVE-2011-1171","CVE-2011-1172","CVE-2011-1173","CVE-2011-1182","CVE-2011-1494","CVE-2011-1495","CVE-2011-1593","CVE-2011-1598","CVE-2011-1745","CVE-2011-1746","CVE-2011-1747","CVE-2011-1748","CVE-2011-1770","CVE-2011-2022","CVE-2011-2534"],"threat":["A local attacker could exploit this to consume all system memory, leading to a denial of service.","If such a device was configured without VLANs, a remote attacker could crash the system, leading to a denial of service.","A local attacker could send specially crafted traffic to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.","On non-x86 systems, a local attacker could exploit this to read kernel heap memory, leading to a loss of privacy.","A local attacker could use this to increase the chances of a successful memory corruption exploit.","A local attacker could exploit this to read uninitialized data from the disk, leading to a loss of privacy.","On systems using InfiniBand, a local attacker could send specially crafted requests to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.","A local attacker could make crafted ioctl calls to leak portions of kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy.","A local attacker could determine the memory layout of processes in an attempt to increase the chances of a successful memory corruption exploit.","A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system or possibly gain root privileges.","On systems with specific hardware, a local attacker could exploit this to write to arbitrary video memory.","By inserting a specially crafted disk device, a local attacker could exploit this to gain root privileges.","A local attacker with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could load existing kernel modules, possibly increasing the attack surface available on the system.","A remote attacker with access to an NFSv4 mount could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.","A local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted block device to read kernel memory, leading to a loss of privacy.","A local attacker with netfilter access could exploit this to read kernel memory or crash the system, leading to a denial of service.","A remote attacker could send specially crafted traffic to read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy.","A local attacker could exploit this to send signals to arbitrary threads, possibly bypassing expected restrictions.","If these drivers were loaded, a local attacker could exploit this to read arbitrary kernel memory, leading to a loss of privacy.","A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.","If this driver was loaded, a local attacker could crash the system, leading to a denial of service.","A local attacker with access to the video subsystem could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service, or possibly gain root privileges.","A local attacker with access to the video subsystem could exploit this to run the system out of memory, leading to a denial of service.","A remote attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service."],"date":"July 13, 2011","info":"linux-mvl-dove vulnerabilities"}
