If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","update":{"10.04":[{"version":"2.6.32-354.67","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-354-ec2"}]},"usn":"USN-1900-1","threat":null,"info":"linux-ec2 vulnerabilities","date":"July 04, 2013","CVEs":["CVE-2012-4508","CVE-2013-2141","CVE-2013-2852"]}
