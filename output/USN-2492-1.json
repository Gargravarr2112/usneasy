Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","update":{"12.04":[{"version":"3.2.0-76.111","package":"linux-image-3.2.0-76-generic"},{"package":"linux-image-3.2.0-76-generic-pae","version":"3.2.0-76.111"},{"version":"3.2.0-76.111","package":"linux-image-3.2.0-76-highbank"},{"package":"linux-image-3.2.0-76-omap","version":"3.2.0-76.111"},{"package":"linux-image-3.2.0-76-powerpc-smp","version":"3.2.0-76.111"},{"version":"3.2.0-76.111","package":"linux-image-3.2.0-76-powerpc64-smp"},{"version":"3.2.0-76.111","package":"linux-image-3.2.0-76-virtual"}]},"date":"February 04, 2015"}
