If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","threat":["An attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory."],"update":{"13.10":[{"package":"linux-image-3.11.0-23-generic","version":"3.11.0-23.40"},{"package":"linux-image-3.11.0-23-generic-lpae","version":"3.11.0-23.40"}]}}
